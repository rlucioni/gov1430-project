      "The goal of this project was to explore privacy on Reddit, the popular social news and entertainment website. On Reddit, users register under a pseudonym, submit content primarily in the form of links, and make text comments on content submitted by others. We set out to harvest personally identifying information from a collection of 15 million comments posted to Reddit between August 28 and September 12. We succeeded in finding hundreds of Reddit users\u2019 Facebook profiles, Twitter handles, email addresses, phone numbers, and ZIP codes. This information allowed us to identify dozens of Redditors with a high degree of confidence. These results demonstrate that the notion of privacy on Reddit is an illusion for many users. Creating a truly anonymous environment on Reddit would require measures preventing users from posting this kind of information. However, such changes would be in direct opposition to the way the community on Reddit behaves."

In their Privacy Policy, Reddit states that \u201cwe will only share your personal data with your consent.\u201d For these reasons, it is reasonable for Reddit users to expect that their personal information is indeed private, and that their \u201creal world\u201d data (e.g., name, date of birth, phone number) is not connected to their \u201cdigital\u201d data (i.e., their Reddit username and content).

      "We found almost 5,000 Facebook URLs, and 19 Facebook profile URLs. Looking at these, they were much more identifying, often tying Reddit accounts to a user\u2019s band\u2019s Facebook page, or even their personal Facebook account. Manual interaction with the results also paid significant dividends. Filtering our results by keywords such as \u201cmy\u201d and \u201ctoday\u201d left us with a much smaller dataset which could be surveyed manually. Specifically, 929 of the comments containing \u201cbirthday\u201d also contained \u201ctoday,\u201d and 814 of the comments containing a Facebook url contained the word \u201cmy.\u201d We discovered that most of these comments were personal; comments like \u201ctoday is my birthday\u201d and \u201clike my page\u201d were common, leading us to believe that this dataset would be much more useful when it came to identifying users."

        "First off, remind him that if he ever changes his mind about what he wants to do, it's perfectly okay.  What's most important is that he finds what he truly loves to do.  But if over the years it still turns out to be roller coasters, then great for him.  Between 18 months and 6 years, I was obsessed with trains, learning about them, and my job choice at the time was to drive them.  Then there was an interim period of a couple of years where it bounced around, and then it was roller coasters.  And encourage him to open his eyes to engineering in general, as it's a really awesome field (though roller coasters are still my main love.)\n",

        "Also, if he goes into engineering, let him know that it is NOT EASY.  You want to know why there is such a shortage of STEM majors in this country?  It's because it's hard.  Last year, I had 80 - 120 hours of lecture, studying and homework a week; I was seriously flirting with the idea of suicide, and I almost failed everything, yet miraculously I passed everything.  (This year looks much easier because I suspect last year was the \"weed out year\" in my university.)  Had I not been as obsessed, I would have dropped out last October and gone to music school (my second greatest love, and something I am equally good at.)  But, if he survives, remind him that the stuff he will be able to do will be nothing short of insane.\n",

        "\n",
        "I'd recommend him to start working on new ride ideas immediately.  This doesn't have to be full fledged prototypes using CAD models, just sketching out some really basic ideas will help.  No rush on quotas or deadlines, just encourage him to think of new ideas.  This is not only fun, but if he comes up with good ones and pursues them, they will be one his greater trump cards when applying for jobs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, when he gets older, I cannot stress enough that he should form professional connections.  There are only five companies in the United States that get regular business, and most of them are small (like 20 people or less.)  That's the nature of the business, it's kind of an oligopoly.  Ask to arrange private tours of rides under construction or something (most American park owners are actually very open to this sort of thing) as one idea to get a toehold.   Then, (what I am doing this November) he should go to the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions Expo in Orlando to form connections for internships and the like.\n",
        "\n",
        "But, something shorter term:  I encourage you to buy him a yearly subscription of \"Amusement Today\" - a professional industry news magazine for Christmas or his birthday.  Also, I recommend to buy him \"No Limits Coaster Simulator.\"  It's a difficult program to use, so he might be incredibly frustrated for a while (actually these might be over his head for now, but still it's something to think about) but it is the best roller coaster design program out there short of professional CAD programs.  You also should have him download \"Newton 2\" which is a free program that is used to build much smoother and more realistic tracks for No Limits (it's very difficult to use, but VERY powerful.)\n",

Sometimes I'd come over to her apartment across the city with a 4L of chocolate icecream and a bunch of bananas and we'd have chocolate milkshakes and talk into the early hours of the morning. But then, as said, we lived together. She started flaking out on me for the few hangout days I had, cheated on her fianc\u00e9e, and just got really crazy.

He was a spellbook-carrying Wiccan too and let me peruse it when I was at odds with my mother. Not sure where he ended up, after highschool he rented a small shitty basement apartment and started smoking pot, and we drifted apart from there.

I left him a long time ago and he refused to accept it, so he turned into a colossal asshole and turned a lot of my other friends against me with his drunken ravings. He also stalked me for years afterwards. I've tried to become friends since but he's made that completely impossible with his constant passes. I moved eight hours away from the city and didn't give anybody he has contact with my new address. His father passed away a while back, I meant to send him a 'my condolences' card but never got around to it.

It wasn't until after highschool that I realized how cool and logical she was and wanted to be friends with her. When I had my blowup with L, she cut off most contact with me because it would conflict with her friendship with L, because she considers L to be a good friend and I now live so far away.

But I'm noticing subtle changes in the way I think. 2 years ago, I would come to work, sit in the guard shack and complain about shit to myself. I would never wash my clothes, see my family, take care of my truck, anything. I blew a head gasket in my truck and it would go through radiator fluid like crazy. I'd drive miles just to get some fast food, come back. Truck temp on red. Fuck it. Tire blew out, rode it for a mile on the way home. Fuck it. Spare for 3 months. Fuck it.

I get my oil changed religiously now, I get a haircut exactly every 30 days. I woke up on my birthday (8/28) and went to my aunt's house. My entire family was there celebrating. They all cheered when I came through the door, but my aunt pulled me to the side. She said that no one figured that I would come by, but that it didn't feel right to let my birthday pass without celebrating it. She told me she loved me for the first time in 4 years. She had cooked my favorite meal with my favorite cake. My little cousins were yelling at me to come help them beat a level on the super Mario wii game. \"You're the best Big Pat!\" I went home and got every wii game I owned and brought it to them. I went and bought some on Friday that I'm going to give them. I feel different. My aunt talks to me more, and it never ends with \"it'll be ok.\" Like it used to, it ends with \"I love you, call me tomorow and bring some clothes hangers when you get a chance.\" or some other variation. I've finally allowed myself to love, and be loved. It can only get better from here. My room is still dirty as all hell though. Maybe ill change that today. \n",

I will get to my question in a moment, but I'd like to thank you for your heart, your passionate views, your humor, your existence in print in Japanese fangirl magazines, for The Office/Extras/Derek being as moving and incredible as they were/are, not to mention everything else... (the singing, your shower/tub double-chin pictures) but I really have to thank you for one thing, and that thing is a round headded twat named Karl Pilkington. I have never enjoyed somebody else's take on life so much, never actually started to sob from laughing (when he was talking about the christmas goat) as I have thanks to you exposing the world to Mr.Pilkington. I run a tobacco shop and we have the \"Congratulations to Local Boy Karl Pilkington; World's Roundest Head\" posted by our register. I'm the bizarre woman who has Karl in his suit and Karl out of his suit with 'Hasn't wore it since' tattooed on her left arm, for all the world to see. I couldn't stop laughing throughout the tattoos, the pain aside, it's fantastic to smile helplessly hard when I look down at my own skin.  ALL OF THIS ASIDE! My question is this: When was the moment when you and Steve really had to pause and consider genuinely encouraging Karl to interact for the XFM radio? As in, which moment really made you or the both of you go 'You know, he's so ridiculous not to share him with the rest of the world-- and what was that surely eye-locking, epiphany of a moment? Thank you again.  I'd like to get the 'getcher knickers off -1940's lady-Karl, but as a pin-up, I just need to conjure it. Thank you, Ricky. I am so overjoyed that this is happening today. \n",

The girl working that night hadn't heard from him in like two hours so she called my uncle who also had not heard from him. She drove over to the office and found my dad slouched over on his desk, dead, from a severe heart attack. Worst phone call ever in my life because I live down in Florida. The girl who found him was about my age and all I thought about was her having to find him like that... Even at the funeral I apologized to her for having to see / deal with that.

I just rolled my eyes and continued driving. One girl began singing some ****ty pop song. It began to make me unbearably angry. I swerved the van violently. The kids started screaming. One boy jolted forward and slammed his head into the seat. \"KYLE HIT HIS HEAD!\" one girl cried out \"MICHEAL, YOU'RE GOING TO KILL US YOU JERK!\" Jessica screamed. I don't know what came over me.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we got home the kids began crowding around the little plastic party furniture begging for food. \"Alright, hold the hell on you brats!\" I said angrily. I went and got the cake and set it out on the table. Grabbing my Zippo lighter from my pocket, I lit the candles. I stood back and watched as the brats began shouting for her to make a wish. As she leaned to blow them out, I spotted her pink panties coming out of her jeans. She was tempting me, that little bitch, I know she was. \"BLOW IT OUT! BLOW IT OUT!\" the shrill monotonous tone rang in my head. I couldn't take it anymore misc! I ran for my room. As I came back out I had donned my viking helmet and held my battle ax mightily above my head. I was naked. The sight of my hairy genitalia swinging back and forth struck fear into the children. \"FOR THOR!!!!!!!!!!!!\" I screamed to the heavens as I charged for the table. I threw my battle ax, chopping a loli in half. Her torso frailed into the air as my battle ax wedged into a wooden bookshelf. I jumped onto one of the plastic chairs, it broke under my weight. I plunged my fist into the cake and smeared it all over my cock. The soft frosting and crumbly texture made me hard. I took a candle and rammed it down my urethra. The kids were frozen with shock. I lit the candle and pushed as hard as I could. The candle rocketed out of my cock and hit a girl in the eye. The force caused me to ****. The girl screamed wildly as her eye was burned out. Her eye socket looked like the perfect hole for my dick. I jammed my cock into her eyesocket and ****ed it. She cried as her head jolted back and forth. The violent jolting snapped her neck killing her instantly. I came.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Kyle boy started to get up to run away so I grabbed a chair and cracked him in the skull. His face landed flat in my **** and he suffocated. \"THE CAKE IS A LIE!\" I said flapping my cock about, shaking cum in several directions. A fat little girl was waddling over to the phone to call the police. \"ITS PINATA TIME!\" I yelled. I grabbed the cake knife, and with my viking prowess, backstabbed the fatty. I slid the knife upwards making a slit in her back. Her fat made it like cutting through cream cheese. I reached in and grasped her spine. With all my strength I tore out her spinal cord. I wanked some little nerdy girl over the head with it. I then set it on the floor and slowly inserted it into my rectum. The ribbed feeling gave me immense pleasure. \"MAY THE THUNDER GODS BLESS ME!\" I exclaimed grabbing my battle ax out of the woodwork. I cut little Suzie's legs off. This made her more ****able. Jessica vomited and passed out. I scraped up her vomit and stripped little Suzy. She was too preoccupied to resist. I smeared the barf all over her vagina. I then licked it off. The taste was god-awful. It made me throw up onto her face. She choked to death on my sick.\n",
        "\n",
        "The commotion made my mother come out. \"SWEET TOASTER ****ING JESUS!\" she screamed. I ran up and FALCOOOOOOOOON PAUUUUUUNCHED her in the vagina. My arm slid all the way up to her womb. I tore the fetus out. As I pulled out a bunch of slimy goo watered out. \"Hey mom want this fetus?\" I asked. She was too busy violently throwing up to answer me. I raised my arm and crushed the baby in my hand. My mother was heaving blood at this point. I took the crushed fetus into the kitchen and slam-dunked it into the blender. \"And now its time for cooking with Micheal!\" I said like a t.v. chef. Adding an eyeball, the fat loli's liver, and Kyle's scrotum into the blender, I turned it on high. I took a sip of my smoothie. It was the most delicious culinary masterpiece in the world. I took the rest and sliding the spine out from *******, I gave myself an enema.\n",
        "\n",
        "My sister began waking up from her concussion. As her eyes opened she awoke to the sight of my hairy ******* pointing in her face. She opened her mouth to scream, now was my time. I launched the smoothie out of my ******* along with watery, bloody ****. Her scream was muffled into a gargle. My sloppy enema shot down her throat. Her eyes were tearing up. The smell was so intense it gave her a bloody nose. I turned around and pointed my hard cock in her face. I positioned it towards her nose. With immense power I ****ed her nose at full force! The blood was an awesome lubricant. The pleasure became more intense. I came buckets right up her nose. My cum went straight into her lungs, tarring them up. As she began gasping for air I looked around the bloody smeared, **** stained room. \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESSICA!\" I said smiling at her tear and enema covered face. She took one last gasp. I gazed happily upon her corpse. The only I regret is that I didn't take my pills today..\n",

        "Here's my story. It was my 19th birthday. I was 19 and felt like a big man. I told myself \"It's your birthday, you say yes to every opportunity today.\" That's how it started. Let me fast forward to my party. My buddy threw a garage party for me and invited a bunch of friends, drug dealers, women, etc etc. One of the guys (dealers) I knew at the time came up to me and said, \"Hey man, I got you something.\" He hands me two stamp sized pieces of what felt like canvas paper. I knew what they were. Oh yeah. I let them soak in my mouth for a while. Mind you, I had been smoking weed all day so I was already out of it. It gets hazy for a while before I find myself standing alone in the middle of this party. And it hits me. As I look across the room I can hear every conversation taking place. I could distinguish between the 10-15 conversations around me separately. I'm listening to EVERYONE talk then all the sudden giant colorful closed caption bubble letters start coming out of everyone's mouth. So if someone said, \"Haha that's funny.\" The letters \"Haha that's funny.\" would slowly crawl out of their mouth. After a while the room was filling up with words. I started getting nervous, you don't want to have a bad trip. Then the words start floating towards me one by one. As they get closer my body absorbs them, and it tickles. I start laughing hysterically it tickled so much. Fast forward 8 hours. The party is dead everyone is gone. I'm trying to my friend so he can either drive me home or let me crash at his place. He's no where to be found so I start my 5 mile walk home. During my walk I robbed a house with the ghost of Biggie Smalls, I took life advice from a giant beetle, and I found a met an old friend along the way. I woke up the next day still in my friend's garage. Apparently I never left for my walk home.\n",

The evening of my party, one of my friends didn't show up at all.  She just skipped out with no word.  Another came to the party for about two hours, then left to have sex with her boyfriend.  Pretty soon all of the others started filtering away as well.  My two closest friends told me they'd forgotten to bring my gift with them, but they'd give it to me later.  A few days after they picked a fight with me and decided we weren't friends any more.  It was a pretty longstanding tradition that they would do this very thing on or around my birthday, and that year was no exception.

        "\n",
        "1. Pictures sent in magnet frames.  He lived in a metal building so he put them on his wall. A lot of guys had metal storage like lockers kind of that they could stick them on too. I also sent him some magnets of his favorite football team to put up.  \n",
        "http://www.amazon.com/Freez-A-Frame-Magnetic-Combo-Pack-Frames/dp/B00007E7P4/ref=lp_3019231_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378263803&amp;sr=1-1\n",
        "2. Crocs for the shower. \n",
        "3. He already had a hard drive, so I got a friend to load a ton of movies and some books on it.  He honestly didn't have as much downtime, but he loved it. \n",
        "4. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.  My husband was in an area that was snowy and freezing in the winter.  I was able to send Reese's cups from October - March. Don't listen to people who say it's too hot to send chocolate, ASK your service member! \n",
        "5. Good hygiene stuff: Gilette Fusion Pro-glide razors.  He had to shave EVERY SINGLE day, so he went through a lot of razors. Also, q-tips. He could only find cheap ones at the PX so I sent real ones with cotton. Shampoo/Bodywash combo. Then he didn't have to take as much to the showers. Kleenex tissues, because gov\u2019t tissues are like sandpaper.  It was my husband's second deployment so he knew to bring his cum towel from home (if he didn't you could send a package of washcloths that you get for a dollar and can be thrown in the laundry bag). Also send a box of burt's bees chapsticks. \n",
        "6. Favorite Snacks.  In addition to chocolate, I sent twizzlers, doritos, funyons. He had a friend who was dying for Flaming Hot Cheetos. \n",
        "7. They had a microwave and the chaplain had a keurig.  The chaplain LOVED to get some k-cups of any kind b/c he shared with everyone. My husband liked cups of campbell's chunky soups and easy mac cups the best.   Also those yakisoba noodles. http://www.maruchan.com/maruchan_yakisoba.html If it has a bowl that you microwave in, it\u2019s fantastic.  Just make sure they have a microwave. Anyone with an off shift or at a small FOB eating MREs for at least one meal a day will LOVE this.\n",
        "8. These \"Go Picnic\" meals: http://www.gopicnic.com/ and tuna pouches. At Christmas, I sent some hickory farms sausage gift boxes.  I tried to send high protein in case he missed a meal.\n",
        "9. Birthday Cake! My husband had the first birthday in his company, but this was such a hit that other guys requested them from their wives. \n",
        "http://www.bakemeawish.com/operation-birthday-cakes.php\n",
        "10. Laundry Detergent.  The local Afghan people did their laundry and he never trusted them to actually add soap, so he would poor some liquid detergent in his bag.  Some people don\u2019t care, but it technically shouldn\u2019t contain optical brighteners.\n",
        "11. I sent him my favorite twin size blanket that I use on the couch. He used it as a blanket at night and he loved that it was mine but was with him.  If you don't want to send your own blanket, you could make a fleece tie blanket with a print of his favorite sports team.   I also sent a set of high thread count twin size sheets.  He just had a sleeping bag to go on top of a mattress. Once he was in his permanent room, I shipped him the sheets/blanket.  I recommend sending two sets, so he could have one while one was in the laundry.  Those days meant sleeping bag.\n",
        "12. He loved this really cheap basic watch from target. It fits the uniform requirements and he didn\u2019t have to worry about the sand ruining a nice watch.\n",
        "http://www.target.com/p/c9-by-champion-men-s-plastic-strap-digital-watch-gray-black/-/A-14051817#prodSlot=medium_1_3\n",
        "\n",
        "Random tidbits. \n",
        "1. I sent separate boxes for snacks/meals and soap/deodorant/detergent, etc.  \n",
        "2. Ask what they already have.  He said he was sick of girl scout cookies and they did not need wet wipes.  He and his friends missed \"good dip\", random snacks which were favorites and they loved any kind of drink mixes. \n",
        "3. You do NOT have to ship flat rate, but I always sent priority.  I discovered halfway through that most of my snack boxes ran about $8 and flat rate would have been $11.  NEVER send through UPS or Fed Ex.  It will eventually end up back with the postal service (which is not going bankrupt for any reason other than the postal act of 2007 which was lobbied for by UPS/FedEx...).  I sent priority b/c my husband's packages would get to him in 5 days and I liked knowing exactly which day something would get there so I could time holidays.  Depending where he is, it may not be so exact. \n",
        "4. If you don\u2019t do it often, then do NOT fill out the customs form until you are at the post office.  Different offices are stringent about different things and if you\u2019ve never done it before the address part can be tricky. \n",
        "5. Packages would get there in 5 days, but letters took 3 weeks.  Therefore, I would generally put holiday cards in the boxes that had stuff for that holiday.  \n",
        "6. Some groups really liked decorations for holidays.  The halloween stuff that seems to be out ridiculous early? Go to dollar tree and send that now!  \n",
        "7. My husband got a pay as you go cell phone which is fantastic for families.  Once I learned his number, I could call or text him.  I wasn't charged if he didn't answer the phone, however text messages were like 50 cents one way.  He did love to get surprise text messages from time to time because it would be like a little bit of normalcy.  The other thing that I could do is text him if I felt like something might be wrong. It would usually just say like \"worrying today, call me ASAP\" and he would know that I was scared and would call when he could.  I sent him an international calling card for the 2/3 day journey back to the US.  At one point they had a stop over and he was able to use the card to call me, but wouldn\u2019t have been able otherwise. I didn't know of anyone who needed calling cards in Afghanistan, because they used MWR phones if they didn't have a cell phone.  \n",
        "8. Don\u2019t send alcohol unless you are willing to be everyone else through  a lot of hell because your friend broke the rules.  Porn can easily be sent on a hard drive if you label it with the name of a current movie, but if any leadership sees or hears it, it will mean room inspections for everyone.\n",
        "9. Do not send candy in Oct-Dec or Feb unless it\u2019s a specific favorite.  Send care packages in late spring through summer when the guys are more forgotten.\n",
        "10. Some guys crave regular good toilet paper. My husband said \"Um I'm not going to advertise to everyone that I'm going to take a shit by putting a roll of toilet paper in my pocket.\" I know I've said it a million times, but ask your person.  \n",
        "11. http://www.amazon.com/Tostitos-Medium-Salsa-Cup-Pack/dp/B008PTXKNW these are a great alternative to glass jars.  I know a vet from the gulf war who said he always wanted salsa, but couldn\u2019t get a glass jar.\n",
        "\n",
        "The only other thing I can think of that the soldiers loved, but I couldn't provide was letters from little kids with pictures (especially their own children). Apparently the little boys drew the coolest pictures b/c all of the soldiers looked like legit super heros shooting laser guns or something.\n",
        "\n",
        "All in all, deployment sucks for everyone in the family.  If you're someone reading this, consider also making up a small basket \"care package\" for a military spouse friend or military children. Families have access to hot showers and yummy snacks, but people don't realize they feel like they are living in some alternate universe where everyone else is going about loving life and they are spending literally half the day praying that their husband is going to make it home alive. It can be really difficult to have such a drastic change when other people around you haven't had such a drastic change.  \n",
        "\n",
        "And if you do nothing else, tell the service members and their families that you are praying for them. I didn't care if someone was Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Pagan, I was happy to have anyone send out prayers and even if you were Atheist and just sending out positivity for my husband's safe return, I felt so comforted and loved and I know that he did too. \n",

I thought he was gross and unattractive and so did my friend, but it was a small grocery store so we talked frequently and became pretty good friends.  He turned 18 and was able to get us booze and my friend (I was naive to how manipulative she was) thought this would be a great opportunity to take advantage of that.\n",

I didn't particularly like him, and I didn't find him attractive, but this was a cycle that continued on for a while until one day in the break room at work he asked me, \"why do you only kiss me when you're drunk?\"  It kind of caught me off guard and made me feel guilty so I decided to kiss him, right then and there.  Soon enough, we made our relationship official, but quickly things went downhill.\n",

I caught my best friend stealing from me, and found out that she had stolen ~$600 of clothing, camera accessories, money, bus tickets and other things and my world came crashing down.  Suddenly he was my only friend and my only support, so while I had been growing less and less attached to him, I felt like I needed to keep him there.\n",

        "In some ways, he was a good boyfriend.  He listened to my endless crying and ranting about losing my friend, and he'd do things like bring me jello when I was upset or sandwiches when I was sick, but he was also just really mean and fucked up too.   He was really racist toward my indian friend, before we even started dating. I wish I had seen what a warning sign that was but I was so desperate and lonely that I tried to ignore it. He was one of those awful militant internet atheists and when he learned my dad was agnostic, went so far as to say \"I hate those fucking fence sitters\".  I was pretty floored. He also spoke of feminazis and he was basically just your standard contrarian douchebag.  On valentines day, my parents got a puppy for me, realizing I needed some distraction from how bad things were, and she was I think the only reason I survived that time. I think maybe he was jealous or something because he liked to play \"devil's advocate\" about how puppies were actually stupid and useless and blah blah blah.  I found this pretty hurtful but I still didn't do anything, I was so scared and lonely.  Our arguing got worse and worse and he was basically just a constant dickbag so I started seeing him less and less.  It wasn't until April though that I finally got the courage to break up with him.  I was high and it was over the phone which was shitty of me, I was by no means a perfect girlfriend and it wasn't fair to him that I kept him around for so long, but I did not deserve at all what came next.\n",
        "\n",
        "After I broke up with him, he made \"most interesting man in the world\" memes about me and posted them publicly all over facebook.  I asked him to take them down and he was being crazy to the point where I nearly got the police involved. After he finally took them down I cut all ties with him, until he contacted me in August and asked me for his stuff back and I wanted mine back too.  He wanted to meet up somewhere but I wasn't comfortable doing that and so I told him I'd rather he just come drop stuff off on my porch.  I never heard anything back.\n",

        "Then, when I had forgotten all about my things, I woke up to a shock on labour day of last year.  My dad woke me up early early to tell me that my ex boyfriend had shown up on my porch at six in the morning, drunk and bleeding from the neck and arms, large knife in one hand, and a backpack with my things in the other. My dad called the police and an ambulance and they promptly fetched him and took him away.  My poor dad was so shook up by this that he decided to install security cameras.  In that bag were my things, including a pair of my underwear (disturbing and creepy).  \n",

I threatened to get a restraining order as he wouldn't leave me alone, and the threat of police involvement seemed to be enough to get him to leave me alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Things were good again until just after my 18th birthday in march of this year when he started to harass me again, this time having the audacity to mention my rapist's full name and how I had apparently forgiven him (?) so why couldn't I forgive ex-bf? This time I spoke to the police and told him again that I was serious about getting a peace bond (in my province restraining orders only apply to common law partners or spouses).  Finally, he left me alone, hopefully for good now. \n",

Older brother tells me he basically left for work before I was awake, like 6am, and got back from work after I was asleep, around midnight (including weekends). Eventually he gets a job at a food chain (like supermarket brand ie. Hostess or Kraft or something for the American equivalent) and he got some normal-ish hours but still low pay. We managed and because the company sponsored stuff we sometimes got free tickets to local theme parks or sports games which was pretty cool. This didn't last long though after he was laid off and was back into a cycle of shit work. Years later and in the present he's luckily found a great job though.\n",

Add to that the fact that the seat didn't stay upright and I had to hold it up while I did my business, and you've got the basic recipe for what followed. One day, I was doing my business, holding the seat up with one hand, when suddenly, my hand slipped, and the seat came crashing down on my wee man bits. I don't remember the incident, and I'm glad I don't. But, I had a boo-boo, and I did what any child my age with a boo-boo does: I ran to mommy and asked her to kiss it and make it better.\n",

        "Now, my mother was apprehensive, to say the least. She could appreciate the fact that I was in pain, but certainly, she couldn't do *that*. So, doing her best to keep a straight face, she sent me to my father. And, in pain as much as I was, I wasn't going to question it. I waddled over to my father, training pants around my ankles, wee man bits turning purple at this point, and I tearfully asked him if he would kiss the boo-boo and make it better. My father, in all his eloquence, shook his head and pointed at my mother.\n",
        "\n",
        "And so it went, for the next couple of minutes. I ran-waddled back and forth between my parents, seeking respite from the pain of a bruised wee-wee, and finding none. At long last, though my mother refused kiss the injured appendage, she did agree to help in the only way she knew how, and really, it was only to appease her grievously injured son. So, she put her hand to her face, kissed the tips of her fingers, and blew in the general direction of my bruised ego. In pain, but satisfied, I went about my business, and would later grow to forget the horrors of that evening.\n",

        "Mio sat up slowly in bed and stretched out her arms, yawning softly. The alarm beside her continued to beep for a few moments before she leaned over and turned it off. She glanced over at her desk where a small, square tin sat wrapped delicately in purple paper and garnished with a light blue bow. Mio smiled to herself, today was an important day, she had a busy schedule ahead of her. She hopped out of bed and headed downstairs to prepare some breakfast. \n",
        "\n",
        "\"Ui will be here soon,\" she thought to herself as she ate her toast and put on some tea. Just as she finished cleaning up the dishes, the doorbell rang.\n",
        "It was Ui's smiling face that greeted her at the door. \"Good morning! Are you ready to do some baking?\" Ui asked as she walked in the door, slipping off her shoes at the entrance. Knowing Ui's baking and cooking skills, Mio had asked her to come by today and help her bake a cake. She wanted it to be perfect, and she knew Ui would be the best to ask in this situation. \n",
        "\n",
        "The pair headed to the kitchen to begin preparations. Mio began taking out ingredients as Ui listed them, making sure they had everything they needed. Ui and Mio talked as Mio stirred together ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Mio insisted on doing all the work to bake the cake, only taking pointers and instruction from Ui as she went. She poured the mixture into a cake pan and set it in the oven just as the doorbell rang again.\n",
        "This time, it was Azusa, Yui, Ritsu and Mugi awaiting her at the door. \"W-w-what are you all doing here?\" Mio asked nervously and a bit surprised. She had hoped they wouldn't find out, but she did invite Ui after all, it was no surprise that Yui had heard about it. \"At least they didn't know what the cake was for, that would just be too embarrassing,\" she thought to herself. \n",
        "\n",
        "Yui replied first, \"we came to help you bake your cake!\" Then Ritsu grinned mischievously and asked, \"you were making cake and didn't invite us?\" \n",

        "Mio turned a light shade of red as she began to panic and search her mind for an excuse. \"W-well.. I.. I-It's..-\", she stammered. Ui chimed in quickly, \"it was supposed to be a surprise!\" To which Mio nodded slowly in agreement. \n",
        "\n",

        "The girls sat around the kitchen table and enjoyed some small talk. The others told Mio they wanted to work on a new song sometime soon. This reminded her of the song she had been working on for the past month; she blushed as she thought about having to perform it for the first time. She hadn't been this nervous about performing since her first few shows, but this one was very special. \n",
        "\n",
        "Mio snapped out of it as the oven timer dinged, letting her know the cake was finished. She checked it, pulled it out of the oven, and set it aside to cool as she took out the icing and strawberries. After the cake was cooled, frosted and topped with strawberries, Mio remembered she still needed to pick out an outfit for today. The others were busy playing a card game and talking, so she excused herself to her room to find a decent outfit. \n",
        "\n",
        "After looking through all of her things, she decided on a simple, white sundress. She didn't want to look too gaudy, but not too casual either, it was perfect. She returned to the kitchen in time to find Ritsu stealing a piece of cake as the others picked the strawberries off the top. \n",
        "\n",
        "\"W-wait! You can't eat that!\" Mio yelled. Ritsu looked up, confused, \"why not? I thought it was a surprise for us?\" Mio knew she should have just told them the truth, but she would never hear the end of it if they knew. It was too late anyway; she couldn't give a cake away that had a slice missing from it. She sighed, \"y-yeah, you're right, go ahead..\" she said, hesitantly giving in. \n",
        "\n",
        "The girls said their goodbyes and headed to the movies for the afternoon, leaving Mio and Ui alone once again. They started working immediately on the new cake to make sure it was finished in time. When the cake was in the oven, Mio left the kitchen to get ready to go out. When she returned, the cake was cooling on the counter and Ui was making some more icing. \n",
        "\n",
        "Ui glanced up at Mio and smiled, \"you look so cute!\" she exclaimed. Mio blushed and managed to let out a quiet thank you. Ui took her leave as Mio finished up icing the new cake. It wasn't as pretty and elegant as the first, but it was unique and she liked it; she only hoped they would like it as well. \n",
        "\n",
        "Mio gathered the tin, the cake and her bass and hurried out the door. She took the train two stops over, and headed out of the station. She looked around, gazing slowly at everyone, searching for someone familiar. \n",
        "\n",
        "Then she saw him. He stood out from the rest of the crowd. His hair was tied back elegantly, allowing you to see the handsome features in his face. His clothes were neat and clean, but casual. As she started toward him, he looked over and saw her; there a moment of awe in his eyes before he smiled warmly at her. \"H-h-happy B-birthday,\" Mio said nervously as she turned completely red in the face. \n",
        "\n",
        "\"She's always so cute when she blushes like that,\" he thought and smiled down at her. \"Thank you,\" he said. Mio took his hand and headed toward the park where they planned to have their date. \n",
        "\n",
        "She presented him with the cake first, \"I-I baked it myself.. I hope it's okay..\" she told him. Next was the tin, she pulled it from her bag and handed it to him, \"open it, please?\" she asked. It was a tin of his favorite tea, she knew he had trouble finding it, so she had ordered some online. Tiriniz smiled and hugged Mio tightly, \"thank you so much,\" he said, \"I couldn't have asked for a better birthday.\" Mio blushed and hugged him back, \"y-y-you're w-welcome\" she said softly, \u201cthere\u2019s\u2026 one more thing.\u201d \n",
        "\n",

I hope you like it.\u201d She began to play a gentle song, it was warm and sweet, but had a bit of a rock feel to it.

How we measure certain aspects of cognition is dependent on the tools the person has. A person with better memory is going to perform better on the type of standardized assessments who's aim is to quantify their intelligence. Thus you get the correlations that you are referring to. To go back to my analogy: A mechanical engineer with better tools is going to be able to make a machine better than someone with higher skill, but lower quality tools.

        "16 Years ago, fuck people, Math, come on.  And it came out in North America on September 17th.  I know that because it came out a month before my birthday.  My cousins got it right before Thanksgiving and it made my holiday.  You can hate it all that you want.  JRPGs aren't for everyone, and FFVII was the last of the golden age of one type of JRPG and the beginning of another.  Today, everything is driven by graphics, cut scenes and flash.  Back then it was grinding and mixing abilities, stats and the right weapons, equipment, magic/materia correctly.  FF7 introduced the FMV as a game driving mechanic to the mainstream audience.   At the time, plenty of people who have still never heard of Chrono Trigger gawked and gasped at the technical brilliance that was embodied in the non-playable parts of the game.  The cutscenes did things that had never been seen on a gaming console.  And the summons just added to the wow factor when Red Materia finally entered the fray in a playthrough.  Still, the customization and seemingly endless sidequests, kept me busy for over a year of real time as I slowly chipped away at the game on PC after my cousins traded it in for Madden 98 (the one who traded it ended up in jail, is that even a surprise?).   I mean, Golden Saucer?  Seriously?  SERIOUSLY?  God I love carnival levels in JRPGs!  Uh.. oops, umm... OK, I might have came a little, no biggy.  Anyway, the point being, FF7 was transcendent, and perhaps in the wrong way.  Since then, Squaresoft has become Square Enix, and they have never made a better game, even they admit that.  Today, their game catalogue includes mobile platform cash-ins, Final Fantasy Online OH MY FUCKING GOD IT FUCKING FAILED 2, and 'Shit, I hate games, but I love bad movies so how about a 6 hour Quick Time Event Run Down One Corridor AND BORE ME INTO BURNING MYSELF ALIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF A HIGHWAY! \n",

Hate on it all that you want, its cultural impact is bullet proof.  It changed the trajectory of the gaming industry and proved that there was a market for RPGs in the West.   Love it or Hate it, FFVII is as important a part of gaming history as any other game.\n",

I rejoiced every time someone would come over and tell me they were quitting too.

It took years and several defining moments to get to not smoking. I had to set up a series of silly-seeming rules that appealed to my love of mind games. It started with no smoking during the daylight hours. Then not smoking unless I was drinking. There was also finding new people to spend my time with (which translated to me reverting to my loner self for a while). I incorporated yoga and half-forgotten therapy techniques to deal with my anxiety. Honestly, it's been 4-5 years since I realized I needed to stop and today.

        "Alright well I (17m) don't remember which one of us added the other on facebook, but eventually I messaged her(15f) and we hit it off instantly. I can still remember that day, sitting on my aunt's couch checking facebook on her laptop when I decided to message her. She had been editing photos an listening to spanish music while I was listening to country on youtube. That was around July 26th of last year. We kept messaging that day, and the next day we messaged as much as possible. Soon when I came back to the states from vacation, we started texting. We literally became inseperable from that July day to The start of the school year. We started calling each other in September when she was going through some emotional stuff and called regularly from then on. Fast forward to December, when we started sending letters to each other, the first was for my birthday, the next was for hers in February. We kept sending letters and in March we started skyping. When I say it was awkward that first skype it was AWKWARD. Growing up, i wasn't all that social and didn't know how to start a conversation with a girl so I winged it. Bam, her mother likes me off the bat, her bro is cool with me, her sis is cool with me, her dad likes me. We spent our first holiday together on skype, watching foreworks on the 4th of July. And now here we are today, fresh off a 1 hour phone call, remembering the crazy year we just went through. She went from stranger to my boo by October, best friend by November, and if there wasn't distance, would have been my girlfriend since December. We both agreed on holding off until I visit her before we're an official couple. I was supposed to visit for summer but couldn't. I'm working on visiting for new years/my birthday since they're 1 day apart but my mom detests the thought of me being with a bisexual girl, let alone a long distance relationship with a bisexual girl. She can't stand the thought of it and is doing everything she can to stop me from going. Her and I skype/call regularly, from once a week to every day depending on our moods. I sent her a hoodie of mine with the first letter so she has something to cuddle with when she feels sad and alone. As of right now, we are looking at an end date of NEXT SUMMER. Yeah it's tough making it through another year but we're fighting on. We play zombies together from time to time, have skype dates, long calls, and hours of texting to keep in good touch. She is the most beautiful girl in the world, smart, funny, kind, caring, loving, sweet, has the most adorable laugh and singing voice, a smile that can change your mood, and eyes I can be trapped in for hours. To me, she's perfect even through her flaws. She is the love of my life. I would link a pic of her but I don't want to unless she okays it. \n",

We were still whispering when the teacher went to the front of the class, and made the announcement. My friend was born in upstate New York, and she knew some friends/family in Manhattan. When she found out, she just leaned against my shoulders. We had went to being excited and happy to immediately being overcome by grief and sorrow. She silently cried, but anyone who was sobbing was escorted to a separate room, and allowed to remain there until a parent came to pick them up.

        "MD5 is flawed under certain circumstances. It is (relatively) easy, due to the birthday attack, to **generate** two different documents that both have the same hash. Imagine you own a car with the VIN number 12345. You generate one document that claims, \"/u/thesprunk is the owner of the vehicle with the VIN number 12345.\" You generate a second document that is a check, made by the DMV, written to /u/thesprunk for the amount of $1,000,000. You walk into the DMV, and get the DMV to certify your claim of ownership of vehicle VIN#12345. The DMV considers that to be a perfectly reasonable request, and certifies the document. You take the certificate, and walk into the bank, and hand them the check for $1,000,000 to the teller as well as the certificate of the ownership of VIN#12345. Since the hashes match, (because you generated the documents that way) the certificate proves that they were **both** signed by the DMV, even though only one of them was. The bank, none the wiser, cashes the check and gives you $1,000,000.\n",

This is a result of people not using large enough bit-lengths for their encryption. So when someone with a lot of computer power comes along, they can essentially just guess the public key/password, and with a little patience and higher electric bill, they can pop the lock so to speak just by running through every possible combination of characters that can constitute its password/public key. this is called brute forcing, and is more akin to using a hairpin and small allen wrench to wriggle your way into the lock and finagle it until the tumblers finally fall into place.\n",

        "For a long, long time I'd been shunned by everyone around me. Even my so-called 'friends'. At school they would stop conversations mid-word if another friend suddenly showed up, and they'd deny that they were friends with me if anyone asked. I eventually turned to just having friends online, because it was easier to meet people that way, and people didn't know they were supposed to hate me. After many years of very brief relationships and feeling like I couldn't trust anyone, since every time I did begin to love and trust someone, they'd quickly prove to me that I was a fool for doing so, I went on an MMO one evening. I was going to get a crew to go do a boss run, but someone's character and name caught my attention. It was very late at night and I was half asleep, and I gave them a derpy nickname that was easier to type. I saw them around every evening from then on and we quickly became close. I told her that I felt like she was my older sibling or something. We were so similar in so many ways we began to call each other 'twin'. \n",

        "Of course, it wasn't long after I met her before I fell in love for her. I knew she didn't feel the same way, so I kept my feelings to myself. It was safer that way, anyway. Within a few weeks, though, she guessed that she was my crush, and she pulled away from me. I thought I had done something wrong and kept trying to make it up to her but it didn't work. She largely ignored me for several months. Usually I can let go of people very easily, especially someone whom I'd known only for two months. But I couldn't let go of her. It tore me up constantly that I'd made her push me away, and I was often in tears about it at night, which was very unlike me. I didn't understand. Why couldn't I just let her go? Finally, I just gave up on trying to get her to contact me. It still hurt, but I wasn't going to try anymore. And there was some nice girl very obviously interested in me, why didn't I spend some time with her? We became close friends and went into the MMO one night to farm. Lo and behold, my 'twin' was in the same area. She said hello and we kept saying hi and capslocking random derpy stuff at each other between farming sessions. My crew dispersed but I stayed there because I knew my 'twin' was going to be there for a while. By coincidence, I ended up in her crew. We ended up taking the crew over and taking them on a boss run. \n",

I bawled happy tears for an hour. Of course, my feelings for her came back full-force. Not that they'd ever left. But I was determined not to let her know, because I was so grateful to have her back in my life, and I was terrified of pushing her away again. A few weeks later she confessed she'd developed feelings for me, and we've been together for over a year now and she stayed with me for a couple weeks around her birthday. \n",

Eventually though, when I finally 'told her how I felt', despite feeling confident she reciprocated, she told me she didn't want to ruin our friendship. This began a feedback loop of painful codependancy that worsened over the course of several months. I just couldn't understand, I was trapped in this mindset of listening to what she said. She said no, that meant no, right?\n",

I would try and distance myself from her, but she wouldn't let me go, and when I told her I didn't want to hang out with her anymore, it would only be a few days before she was sending emails to me about how much she missed me and how she couldn't stop thinking about me.

She would come on to me, hold my hand, try to spoon me, and one time even, she actively, and desperately tried to initiate sex. I never did.

Why would she lie?\", I would tell myself, but when it started reaching those levels of insanity, and I asked her if she would do that to any of her other friends, and she actually said yes, I began to have my doubts.\n",

        "When things finally fell apart, she went around telling all her friends and acquaintances what a creepy loser I was.

There were two or three times when she 'put her foot down' and explicitly broke up with me, but I never showed a single sign of caring in the slightest when she did. Imagine my surprise when each time it happened, within one or two weeks, she was back on the horse.

I try to feel good about the notion that I am simply a mote of dust on a rock out in space.

        "########\n",
        "Sorry for my curt message. I was having a complicated night, and that was actually a \"fuck it\" 5th draft, lol. Basically, a wedding (from what I have observed) is an event which in principle exists to celebrate love, commitment, and the joining of new family. Unfortunately, it's also a complicated mess. You've got both men and women who are both taught that a wedding is a big deal from birth basically. Especially women are focused on this being \"their day\" (kind of like a birthday party on megasteroids). So they're afraid that they're going to fuck up their own big day in some way: complicated emotions and expectations. Then there are the guests. They can be *potential* problems for what I consider two main reasons.\n",
        "\n",
        "1-they don't contribute to the event. I'm not talking monetary contributions. It's kind of like if your family comes over for a big dinner at your house, and someone doesn't thank you for putting it on, or they make a mess and just leave. It's about them outing themselves as not really caring about the host. They're just along for the free food. Now, that's not everyone, in fact it's only a few people, but each problem adds to the overall weight of the day. On top of finding out about people's true motives and feelings, you often have to invite and pay for people who you hate because grandma would be so sad if they weren't there or whatever reason.\n",
        "\n",
        "2- some people will resent the fact that it is not their day. This can be in the form of a woman who got married and now feels like her day has passed and all the fun and excitement is gone. Any drama queens will use a wedding to make it about them rather than the celebration and do something like constantly make little shitty remarks like \"oh you went with red? it's not very original...\" (think Mean Girls; guys can do this too) or they can make a scene, for example interrupting the first dance with a drunk toast that falls into a sobbing monologue about their ex-boyfriend that hurt her so bad etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, a guest will either be very supportive, polite, apathetic, rude, or inappropriate. I've been to a few weddings of around 200+ people, and believe me there will be some issues. Add to that the stress of managing 200+ people and the inevitability of some food issue (people get REALLY cranky when their food is disrupted), and you've got yourself a wild ride.\n",
        "\n",
        "So why have a wedding if it's so bad? Well, for one, in theory they're awesome and fun (for guests; again my experience). They also serve to make the relationship feel official. This is incredibly important for some people. And the final reason for today... it's tradition. Even though there may be a better way, and the bride and groom insist on doing x differently or instead, the parents and grandparents can be very forceful. I am very easygoing. I don't care about weddings. In fact, I wasn't really keen on having one, but my wife wanted one, so we did it. I managed to insist on immediate family and closest friends only, and even with that, my wife (who is a very sweet person) was justifiably driven to tears several times.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion (what is this, an essay? I don't know, I had a bad sleepless night and I'm still tired), weddings bring out the best and worst in people. Some will become solidified as true friends, others you'll want to never see again in your life. But it is in no way an easybake princess cakewalk for the bride and groom.\n",

I'm not letting you in unless you bring 6 girls.\"  My cousin walks over to the regular line and asks a group of girls if they wanna go to the VIP section with us.  They agree.  They were all from Mexico and one girl like myself was celebrating her 21st birthday. So we wait in line.  Then after about 45 min, one of the girls gets a text and says \"we have 2 other friends coming.. can they just cut in line here?\"  Sure why not... The two friends ended up being another girl and a gay guy.  The bouncer started letting people in couple by couple.  After about another hour, all that was left was me, the 21 year old girl and the gay guy.  ANOTHER half hour passes.. Gay guy starts getting pissy.  He started snapping at the back of the bouncers head going \"Hellooo! We've been waiting forever!\" Another bouncer walks by and yells at him saying \"hey! Don't snap at his head!\"  The two bouncers exchanged a look to eachother.  From that point I knew I wasn't gonna get into the club.  So we waited a few minutes more and I'm making friendly conversation with the girl.. Then at one point I pulled her back and said \"you know, the only reason we're not getting in is because of him..\" she goes \"I know! I don't even know him! He just started hanging around us today!\" I said, \"So lets get rid of him...\"  I walked up to the gay guy and said \"you know, we might as well just walk in now.. the bouncers aren't even paying attention.\"  he goes \"you really think so?\"  I answer \"yea totally! Just go under the rope and sneak in!\"  He does it... a few seconds later hes getting dragged out.  We waited another half hour or so and the girl started breaking into tears because her Vegas trip was ruined.  I kinda went into alpha mode at that point (very out my character) and said, \"You know, you're pretty much the only person I know here... We could just go to our own rooms and call it a bad night OR we could just bar hop.... I'll even buy you your drinks as a happy birthday from me.\"  She says ok.  We got shit faced! Started making out and all that.. Then I invited her to my room.. Stupid me forgot which room I was in so like a dumbass I went on our floor and pretty much tried every door until my key worked. Got her in, started drinking even more... At that point in time, I was still a virgin and had no idea what to do.  I'm trying to think \"ok.. how do I get her on the bed..\"  The best I could think of: \"OH GOD! This bed is soo comfy!\" She jumps on! \"Holy shit! It worked?\" We started making out more and then started undressing and stuff.. I ended up hooking up with her.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Afterwards, we're doing the awkward thing where we get dressed and then look at each other and giggle.. she gets a call from her sister and she leaves... I realize I haven't even looked at my phone because I left it in the room before we went to the club. I check out my messages and I have 26 unread texts from my cousins.  They all said \"GET Out!\" \"Shes stealing from you!\" \"You're gonna lose all your money!\" And immediately starting flipping the fuck out.. I went through all my stuff.. still there.  My wallet.. still there (although I run out of cash completely).  \"What gives?\"  Eventually I got a knock on the door and it was my cousins and their friends falling into the room piss drunk while laughing.  I went \"what the fuck was with these messages?!\" and my cousin looks at me and goes \"wait.. those went to you?! HAHAHAHAHAHA! We went to a strip club afterwards and Mike went to the vip room with a stripper. We were trying to tell him not to use all his money but I guess I was texting you by mistake.\" \n",

        "Beatrice Stetson knew that, ultimately, her life was going to end. Many people know this too, but few come to an understanding with such a bold acknowledgement of her morality as she did on one rainy September night. Her husband had just died. She would tell her grandchildren he had gone peacefully in his sleep, but in reality he had died an excruciatingly long albeit painless death. He was scared. After his second stroke he had trouble forming words, but was he lay in the hospital bed Beatrice heard a faint \"No.\" repeated constantly between strained breathing.\n",
        "\"No no no no no no\"\n",
        "He was crying at the end. Not ready to leave the world he had grown to love. It wasn't fair. Not on him, not on Beatrice. Beatrice had decided not to go down with such fear and sadness as he had. She treat death as an unpleasant but necessary aspect of life, like when as a child she would cry when it was time to go home from a birthday party. There was still cake to eat, games to play, why leave now? She understood that all things must come to an end, be it birthdays or life. \n",
        "Years after her husband, she found herself in the same hospital, just a few doors down from where her husband had died, strapped down to various machines that beeped and whirred to keep her waiting for the inevitable. They were chains that bound her to this life, and kept air in her lungs and blood in her veins. And she hated them. Why wait? It was only a matter of time. She swallowed any doubts she had and began undoing the tubes and wires on her arms and chest. Her hands shook, but she continued the task. Suddenly, a voice spoke.\n",
        "\"That's pretty dangerous, y'know.\"\n",
        "On a chair at the opposite end of the room sat a young man, with a warm smile. He didn't look like any attendant or doctor she had seen, and he was dressed in a white shirt, with black trousers and waistcoat, and a crimson red tie. He had stubble on his chin and long grey hair tied back in a ponytail, which seemed unusual for someone his age.\n",
        "\"You can't stop me. I've already made up her mind.\" She tried to sound strong, but her voice shook, and her hands had stopped working on the various clasps.\n",
        "\"Stop you from what?\" His gaze was casual, yet sharp and analytical. Who was he? A lawyer?\n",
        "\"Well, weren't you trying to kill yourself?\"\n",
        "\"I... I don't want to wait anymore. I want to see my husband, my friends... I don't want to be old and tired and cold all the time.\"\n",
        "\"Is that so?\" He paused for a moment, then stood. \"In that case, I have some good news and bad news...\"\n",
        "He paused again.\n",
        "\"The good news is that you don't have to wait anymore. Ms. Stetson, on the 4th of May, 2013, at 6:47pm, you died.\" \n",
        "What? The date he had said was today, but how could she have died? Was there no bang? No slow decent into darkness? The man continued.\n",
        "\"Now a death like your was quite unusual. Although you weren't the only one to pull the plug on yourself, you were one of the few who succeeded. A flawless execution, if you'll excuse the pun. You did, however, ruin the week of a nurse who had started at that hospital the day before. She'll get over it though.\"\n",
        "He looked out of the window. What was a clear day was now shrouded in a pinkish-white fog.\n",
        "\"Does that mean... Is this the afterlife? Heaven? Can I see my once gone friends and family?\"\n",
        "He smiled sympathetically.\n",
        "\"That brings us on to the bad news. It could be argued that this is the afterlife, but I'm afraid that this is more of an epilogue to your life. You can use this time to ask any questions, seek consolidation, anything you ask, I'll try my best to help.\"\n",
        "\"So there is no pearly gates? No chorus of angels?\"\n",
        "\"No, the religious interpretations of life after death are more of a coping mechanism, only believed because people want to believe it. I'm not saying all religion is falsified, the first edition of the bible was completely true, though after two thousand years it was warped, like a game of Chinese whispers.\"\n",
        "\"I see...\" She thought for a moment. It was certainly a lot to take in. \"So what happens next? Do I just disappear?\"\n",
        "\"In a way, yes. Even I don't know what goes on next, because it's different for each person. Try to think back to the last dream you had. Did you know you we're dreaming? We're you aware that in reality you were laying in in bed, fast asleep?\"\n",
        "No. The answer didn't need to be said aloud. \n",
        "He spoke again. \"Beatrice, I'm sure you've heard many times before that death is like falling asleep. The truth is, it's much more like waking up. Eventually you will forget this life, and move on. It usually takes a couple days.\"\n",
        "\"Days? So there is something after this 'waking up'?\"\n",
        "\"Oh yes, but me explaining that would be a complete waste, as you're going to find out soon enough.\" \n",
        "\"But it can't just be like this! Are you telling me this entire life was a waste of time? If I had had died as an infant would we be having the same conversation? What was the point?\"\n",
        "A flash of annoyance surfaced on his face. He adjusted his tie as he spoke. \n",
        "\"Tell me Ms. Stetson. Did you enjoy life? Would you regard the relationships you forged with countless people, the beloved memories of your past, or the impression you left on the people you met along the way as '\n",
        "'?\"\n",
        "\"N-no...\" \n",
        "He smiled once more.\n",
        "\"Then it was a fulfilling and entertaining use of your time.\"\n",
        "Beatrice thought as she looked out the window. The fog was closer that before.\n",
        "\"How much time do we have left?\"\n",
        "\"As long as you can remember your last moments, we can talk. The fog is just what you can't remember. For example, what order were the cars parked outside in?\"\n",
        "\"I have no idea.\"\n",
        "\"Therefore, you cannot see past the fog. You could say this place is constructed of your memories, though I find that a tad Sci-Fi.\"\n",
        "The fog rolled in through the window panes. What colour were the drapes? How many chairs were there in the room? It seemed that the harder she tried to remember, the faster she forgot. She filled her thoughts with that of her husband, his face, his voice, how he used to... How he...\n",
        "\"Ah, it seems our time is up. I hope it has been a pleasure, Beatrice Stetson.\"\n",
        "The fog enveloped the man. \n",
        "\"Come on, you old bat. Surely you can remember your husband's name? She was crying. Damn, isn't this what she said she wouldn't do? She cried even more. Is this really the end? Remember him... Remember him... Remember... \n",

She held the baby in her arms, such a tiny thing. The baby cried as only a newborn could. Such sadness, for someone who had just been granted the gift of life. What could she possibly be sad about? The Mother and daughter made eye contact. Tired eyes peered, into young eyes, and young eyes stared right back. The crying stopped, as the baby lay entranced by the new person before her.\n",

        "My earliest memories are of here.  This small building tucked away in Eastern Daggermark.  So simple.  So ordinary.  The locals called it the Church of Milani.  But to me, it was home.  A safe haven from the cruel outside world, from evils like Janna Smilos and her Assassins' Guild, or Tragshi and his Poisoners' Guild.  Although none of them held any business with me.  \n",
        "\n",
        "You might be asking.. why do I live in a Church, and why do I share my last name with the Goddess we worship?  It's dullingly simple really.  Like several others without a family the Church raised me within its humble walls.  Like the others, as well as some of the adult believers, I carry the name of our Goddess as my surname, so all will know who I am and what I belive in.  My first name, Alexis, translates to defender.  So it could be said that my name literally means \"Defender of the Church of Milani\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Life here in Daggermark hasn't been so bad.  For the past few years the Church had allowed me to move from the orphan's quarters and lodge in the uppermost room.  It's a wonderful view, and I can even see Dagger River over the city walls.  It's a great place to be alone with my thoughts.. that is when little Rikkon isn't pestering me.  He means well though, and after all, I'm the closest thing to a big sister he has.\n",
        "\n",
        "Growing up in Milani's Church hasn't been as dull as you'd think.  It's not all books and prayer and worship.  No.  We're a Church of action!  We seek to actually make a difference in the lives of the downtrodden and oppressed, and for that Milani blesses us.  The lower basement of the Church serves as a meeting hall for the more.. militant.. branches of the Church.  People who risk their lives for the betterment of strangers.  I used to sneak down at night when I was younger and lie on the floor, peeking under the great wood and iron door and listen to the warriors tell their tales of fighting demons and the undead over beef and ale.  Oh what tales!  I'd listen for hours!  It earned me a deep respect for the tenants of our faith and those who carry it out at the edge of a sword.  It also.. earned me a few punishments from the High Priest.\n",
        "\n",
        "After a few years, I managed to convince them to let me train with the men of the faith.  It took a lot of doing, but finally on my 21st birthday I was told I would be allowed to join the militant wing of the Church.  (After proper training of course!)  Oh the excitement!  I mean, I'll never understand those girls who just waste away their lives, playing with dolls and planting flowers.  Not me!  I'd been raised my whole life by the Church and it was finally time to give back.\n",
        "\n",
        "The men had a secret training lodge, out in the forest southeast of the city.  Trips there would take several hours, and trainings would last upwards of a week at a time.  I'll never forget the first day.  I thought I was ready to show them all.  It turned out I had a lot to learn. *blush*  But over the next couple of years, my skills gradually improved.  I learned the ways of combat and trained in the weapons of war, including Milani's favorite weapon.. the deadly Morningstar.\n",
        "\n",
        "Everything changed one hot summer morning.\n",
        "\n",
        "I had gone away with the men to the training lodge, and we were 3 days into a long training session.  That's when old Gryff rode up.  He looked horrible, his cerimonial robes soaked with blood.  He was wounded, and the pain contorted his face.  Hurredly he told the men the news.  It sounded impossible, numbing.  It felt like I was listening from outside my body as he told us the story.\n",
        "\n",
        "A large group of demons from the Worldwound had escaped into the River Kingdoms.  They found a way inside the city and had murdered dozens, if not hundreds.  Even worse they took some children as prisoners for sacrifice as they fled the city to return to their evil masters at the Worldwound.\n",
        "\n",
        "Immediately the men of Milani mobilized, rushing back towards Daggermark to offer any aid that might be needed.  I silently fell in at the back on my own horse and followed.  I knew if I drew too much attention they might forbid me from going with them.  However, when we finally arrived it was already too late.  The demons, we were told, had been gone for hours.  The streets ran red with the blood of demons and innocents, and the sounds of great wailing permiated the air.  Sulfer hung dense in the air as several homes had been put to the torch.\n",
        "\n",
        "I rode through the streets, faster than I ever dared before, towards the Church.  My heart raced as I prepared myself for what I might find.  When I finally reached home, I lept from my horse and ran to the doors.  The great doors of the Church had been rent asunder, and as I made my way slowly inside, Morningstar readied, an earie sense of calm washed over the area.  It felt as if I were walking through a cold, lifeless crypt.  \n",

It was clear that a part of the demon's mission in Daggermark was to attack the Church, probably due to some of the members assisting followers of Iomedae in the Mendevian Crusades.  They weren't in Daggermark by accident, they were here to send a message.  It was believed that a few of the children were taken by them back towards the Worldwound to be sacrificed.  \n",

Being 17 and hearing all this was very hard to deal with, and I began to drink a lot, go out to parties, take A LOT of drugs, etc. Basically, I surrounded myself with people constantly when I wasn't visiting my mom in the hospital. I kept all these activities hidden for as long as I could, but eventually I got arrested for the drugs. I went in front of a judge, who gave me a choice between 6 months in jail or 28 days in rehab.

The nurses then gave me a piss test, and two days later, I was told that I failed the test because they found increased levels of THC in my urine (compared to the tests they gave us every 3 days.) I was flabbergasted because I had legitimately stayed away from any drugs while I was out, and my main concern was being there for my mom while she was dying. My entire family hated me for being in that situation in the first place, and they saw it as an extra hard stab in the back when I \"failed\" the test. The whole thing ended up being a mistake in the reading of the test results, and I was legally excused from the consequences. That being said, my family had always praised me for being smart, so they just assumed I had found some way of manipulating my councilors and whatnot, but still guilty nonetheless. \n",

It requires a lot of thought (I've never thought about which oils I'm going to buy and use as hard as I have in this), and a willingness to either work through the science or just trust it--try suggesting to a skeptical friend/coworker/physician that they watch a 75-minute video by Peter Attia sometime.

My mother and the other troop members were nowhere to be seen, she'd just hand me off to one of her psychotic troop leader friends [not all troop leaders are psychotic, but N-mother made friends with all the ones that were] and I would be expected to do anything and everything they asked, up to and including watching their children and cleaning their house, for free. If I bitched or refused, I caught hell. This was totally free labor- even my parents weren't collecting money, and I was told it was my duty as a Scout.

Unfamiliar shapes loomed in the unlit landscape, and I ran headlong into a thorny rose bush which seemed to materialize before me. I cursed as I tried to disentangle myself from its sickly sweetness. Lee hauled me out just as the glow of the relentless headlights illuminated the yard.\n",

He wasn't mean about it, though, so we all laughed and played along. His mom baked him a cake that was gooey and sweet. Tater ate three pieces and got a stomach ache.

She was alright during the day, he said, but at night, she'd lock herself in her room and was dead to the world. Tater didn't know so he didn't realize how uncomfortable he was making Lee with his questions.\n",

        "\"We'll be fine,\" I said.\n",

We stopped in the shadows just outside the radius of a glaring streetlight, out of breath and grinning like idiots. \n",

        "Anytime we heard a car, we'd retreat to the nearest shadows, huddling together until they passed us by. But this time, instead of receding into the night, the headlights stopped just in front of us. Three men in dark jumpsuits and horrible animal masks stepped out of the idling van and into the bright lights. \n",

        "\n",
        "We weaved through side streets and backyards and looped in unpredictable circles. But every time we seemed to have lost them, those headlights would appear again, and we'd hear their gruff voices calling at us through the darkness. If we sat still long enough, they would get out of their vehicle and chase us on foot, which is how they got Tater. In the end, Tater's star had not kept him safe. He was gone and we were hiding in the prickly branches of a stranger's tree.\n",

We stopped in our tracks and looked at each other, the defeat that I felt reflected in his eyes. The pig and the zebra swept in and dragged Lee away. He struggled and kicked, but they were too strong, too big.\n",
        "\n",
        "I ran, crying and ashamed at my own cowardice. I let them take them, my two best friends in the whole world. When they needed me, I ran. And I kept running. There was still a chance. If I could get back to Lee's house soon. I could call the cops and still protect his family, and maybe just maybe they could find these guys and save my friends. It was a long shot, but I couldn't see any alternative.\n",

I just had to turn the corner and I was home free. I kept expecting world to light up around me, to see the headlights bearing down on me. But they never did. I turned the corner.\n",
        "\n",
        "The van was parked in front of Lee's house. The twisted pig leaned against the bumper, smoking. My shoulders slumped and my heart stopped in my chest. It was over. They didn't have to hunt me down. They let me come to them. I knew I should turn around and flee. But I'd retreated too many times today. Let too many people down. The only direction I was willing to run in was straight ahead. \n",
        "\n",
        "I pulled the throwing star out of my pocket and gripped it in my hand, wedging one vicious spike between my ring and middle fingers. I charged, screaming. The pig dropped his cigarette and raised his hands. I felt a grim satisfaction when I realized he was afraid. \n",
        "\n",
        "Then I was on him. Punching. Stabbing. Kicking. Clawing. I couldn't take them all, the pig, the rabbit, and the zebra. But I could hurt this one. And I did. \n",
        "\n",
        "He had stopped moving by the time I felt strong arms pull me off him.  The throwing star slipped from my bloody grip, but I no longer cared. They threw me to the grass, and I lied still on my back, breathing hard and looking up at the lightening dawn sky. I heard yelling and crying, but none of it mattered any more. I was done.\n",

        "I was curious if there was anyone else out there who shares this day of birth. I was born on 9/11/1991. I turn 22 today. I remember the day we were attacked. I was 10 years old in the 5th grade. I was so excited that day, it being my birthday and all. I usually spent my birthday with my family (I was 10 so no clubs for me!) and I remember my older sister saying \"We're going to go get ice cream and watch a movie!\"\n",
        "Anyways, I went to school that day and I remember sitting there talking with friends and my teacher, Mr. Kamp, gets a phone call. I've never seen a teacher look so worried. All I remember is him saying \"Oh my god, oh my god really?\" Then he turned on the TV and we all saw it. I was young so I couldn't really process how serious this was. All I remember was that they kept replaying the plane crashing into the building. I honestly don't recall if we all went home early or if we stayed the regular schedule.\n",
        "Little did I realize, my birthday was ruined I got home and my older sister wasn't so excited anymore. She looked at me and pretty much said we aren't doing anything today. To this day, I don't really celebrate on the 11th that much. I kinda just sit around and hang out, maybe hold it off a day or 2 and then celebrate. Last year was my 21st b-day and all my friends and family pretty much forced me to go out and drink. They said it's okay and it's my birthday, I should be able to celebrate. We went out to a few bars by the beach and I got hammered...\n",
        "Anyways, Anyone else have a similar experience? Do you remember everything? Please share!\n",
        "Another crazy thing is that my brother-in-law is exactly 20 years older than me. He was born on September 11th too. It wasn't easy growing up. Especially since my birthday was on the 11th and I'm Arab. I actually just remembered being picked on for being Arab and having my b-day on the 11th. A hindu girl called me a terrorist... I said fuck you. I was 13. It happened occasionally. I got over it.\n",

Coupled with a chest holster with straps that'll fit comfortably over a sweater or even heavy jacket, I think I'll be pretty safe if I have to fight a bear over the same patch of berries!\n",

In the beginning he was struggling with all the bandits, but he made up for it in the middle and in the end. I underestimated him.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rythian: I think he's as good as Lewis, but the early war set him back. He could have had a chance at winning. He had 12 votes in the endgame, which showed that he knew how to play, while the other had 4/6. I'm interested to see how the next series will play out for Rythian and Duncan. Maybe they will work together, but I don't count on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sjin: From the beginning Sjin choose to go for a second place, because he knew he couldn't beat Lewis. I think Lewis wouldn't have been a major power if Sjin and Lewis also started an early war. Maybe that would have made the game far more interesting, but it would have been a big risk for Sjin. In the middle of the game, Lewis was too advanced for Sjin, attacking him would mean death. He couldn't do it without the help of the others, but he didn't say anything.\n",
        "\n",
        "Duncan: He chose the wrong Civ again. He didn't know how to play Venice and he didn't know how to play India. He should have played like Rythian, building a few big cities. On his top, he had 8 cities I think. He was constantly on the border of his happiness. I hope he chooses a better Civ next time, and he tries something else than just attacking everyone, like going for a diplomatic victory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lewis: In about 0 AD/BC (I don't know) he surpassed everyone, and became the top player with an increasing lead. Because of this lead, he could build all the wonders before others could, giving him an extra bonus. Somewhere around 1500 AD he was already unstoppable, but nobody saw it/did something about it, so Lewis kept growing. What suprised me is that Lewis suddenly went for a Domination Victory, while it is more exciting, I thought he would do a Scientific Victory. He had a lead in science, and focused a lot on science in general. He was clearly the best player.\n",

His own mother, spent time in prison on a trial for plotting to blow up New York police departments with the infamous panther 21. His God father was geronimo pratt who was targeted by the FBI illegal Cointelpro. And his god mother is Assata Shakur who is also wanted for domestic terrorism, that Tupacs step-dad broke her out of prison and is now living in Cuba. Bush in 2003 put a $1 million reward on her head during the revival of targeting domestic terrorists at the start of the war on terror. In 2011, Jon Stewart and Bill O'Reilly had an argument over her, as Obama invited an artist to the white house who supported Assata Shakur.

        "Set Difficulty to Hard. Yes hard is a must. It\u2019s harder and it\u2019s Scarier.\n",

        "Focus on the aspect of Survival. You are not in a rush to build a Castle and settle down. Think only about you and your environment. Take one day at a time. Live the game.\n",
        "Don\u2019t spend 3 days collecting stuff and the fourth building a complete mansion. You should build a small house first.\n",
        "Don\u2019t go big from the start! Instead of building a Melon Farm of 100X100 melons, rather plant just 1 melon next to your house. This seems crazy but it works. When you want melon, Go get your melon, your melon is finished, And your chest is not packed with melons you probably won\u2019t eat.\n",
        "When it comes to your first house, again don\u2019t go Big! Build a small house under a tree about 4x5. With 1 door and a few windows. Big houses make us too comfy and feel way too safe. Small houses make the world your boss again.\n",

        "Make your doors Zombie Friendly. We always put something in front of our door to keep all the monsters out. Then our houses become too secure. Instead of a \u2018zombie-luring-cactus trap\u2019, just make a door and that\u2019s all. If a zombie slams on it, open the door and deal with him (or them).\n",

        "Mine at morning, hunt at night.\n",
        "When it comes to mining, don\u2019t strip mine. The tunnels you mine should be zigzag and crazy (like it was on your first mining day). In long strips we can see monsters from a mile and quickly shoot them down. Unorganized tunnels will provide more surprise monsters.\n",
        "Again when mining, Use very little torches! Or if you want to you can use all the redstone you get and use redstone torches as a lighting method to create a more scary feel.\n",
        "Don\u2019t bring everything to your house, Go get it. Instead of building a pond for water next to your house, Go get water when you want it. Plant reeds next to natural rivers.\n",
        "When you are giving animals food to populate, do it where you found the animals. They should be free to roam where they want. When you need drops from animals you will then have to hunt for it instead of just swinging your sword in a fenced area.\n",
        "Make use of variety! Don\u2019t just eat Pork chops for 10 days. Try and get something else to eat each night. Do a quest to create some mushroom stew or make some Pumpkin pie.\n",
        "Build all your houses with wood. Cobble and Stone are too fortified. Wood is basic and old school.\n",
        "Instead of using iron for armor, use it for other things. Try and stick to leather armor. Color them different colors. Don\u2019t stick to a 1 color full set. Be creative. Try and get your colors to camouflage.\n",
        "Go fishing away from your home.\n",
        "Don\u2019t make your yard a Zoo. All animals should be hunted. The sound of thousands of chickens mutes the sound of the scary night.\n",

        "Compass: Create 1 compass and use it. Travel far and always keep this Lucky Compass with you!\n",
        "Clock: Create 1 and Schedule it when mining.\n",

        "-Where to build a house-\n",
        "Build your small house out in an open field that is covered in monsters at night or build it in a forest under the trees. Surround yourself with possible dangers.\n",
        "-Add a little Role-Play to your game-\n",
        "Roleplaying can add multiple goals for your world. Instead of imagining to defeat the dragon, rather make the dragon a fairy-tale and hope to one day slay it. Stick to everyday stuff.\n",

Like today, one of my Mormon friends' neighbor's 98th birthday is today, and he drove her 345 miles (she has no living family) to her favorite restaurant and they ate dinner there. I totally admire him as a human being. If religions didn't exist, the world would be filled with even more ridiculously mean and hateful people. I also agree with the fact that people need something to fill in the blanks with. It soothes them and allows for there to be something to turn to when they are having troubled times. I take comfort in believing that no matter what happens, it all leads to the same outcome: death.

        "-My mother's a sociopath and abused me mentally and emotionally all through my childhood. At 15 she kicked me out and I'd been living in a mutually beneficial arrangement with my grandfather ever since. Years pass. I discover the internet and start going online at the local college since I'm too poor to afford my own machine. One day Mom sends me an email asking if it's okay if she comes over to the house to visit Grandpa. I tell her I'm fine with the two of them having a good relationship, but that I will likely leave the room if she comes over. She replies back, asking what she could do to make me more comfortable.\n",
        "\n",
        "THE DECISION\n",
        "\n",
        "This pissed me off. I wrestled over whether to say nothing, or to fire back a response explaining that there's really not a damn thing she could do to make me feel comfortable since she fucked my brain up throughout my childhood and never even admitted to any of it.\n",

As we talk further, I tell her we cannot reconcile until she fully listens to me about what she did to me. She agrees. And as I pour out my grievances, not sparing her feelings in the slightest, a miracle occurs. She apologizes for damn near everything. Things I'd *dreamed* of her saying to me, she's saying now. She's actually changed. I'm astonished. I'm willing to forgive her, something I would have thought impossible just the previous year.\n",
        "\n",
        "(Important additional info: Grandpa and I are living in the house with my Aunt. My mom also has a new husband; Stepdad.)\n",

        "-My Aunt has schizoaffective disorder and when family tragedies occur, she goes berserk. After three days with Grandpa in the hospital, she's bringing tree limbs in the house, shitting in the beds, getting thrown out of a freakin' Irish pub, and kicking me out of the house in a fit of rage because I dared visit my friend on his birthday.\n",
        "\n",
        "-I call Mom from a payphone. She agrees to take me in for a while. Later, she and Stepdad talk with Grandpa about getting Aunt committed. Aunt is taken away, but by now she has trashed the house. Totally unfit for habitation. So after Grandpa leaves the hospital, he comes to stay with me, Mom and Stepdad at their place. They promised to take care of him for as long as he needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "-Things are fine for about a month. Grandpa rehabilitates while Stepdad and I try to get the trashed house fixed up. Then Mom's old behavior patterns begin to surface. Things she *promised* me she'd never do again, she begins to do again. Weird threats, narcissistic attention-seeking, feigning distress to make Stepdad side with her against me. I am not actually doing anything to her, except in her mind. Essentially, she's starting to realize that I'm not the idealized version of me she has in her mind, and Mom does not like that. So she creates strife and blames me for it, claiming that I'm 'torturing' her because I disagreed with her and demanding Stepdad come home from work (30 minute drive away) to act as mediator. When he comes home, he sees me calmly explaining things and her throwing a crazy fit, and sides with me. RED ALERT.\n",
        "\n",
        "-The next day, she manufactures an even bigger crisis (because I wasn't enthusiastic enough about her cooking) and uses it to claim she can't deal with me being in the house anymore. Grandpa stands up for me, saying I've been doing an excellent job taking care of him (I cried a little bit to hear him say that; he's not a man of many compliments). He lays down an ultimatum: \"If he goes, I go.\" Mom takes this offer literally. Next thing I know, she has kicked us both out. She drops us at our house and drives off *smiling*. The house is in the middle of painting and recarpeting, so the gas is off, the electricity's off, there's no food in the fridge and all the furniture's covered in sheets. *She punted an eighty-year-old stroke victim into an uninhabitable house, Her Own Goddamned Father, just to hurt me.*\n",

        "-The next day, by sheer luck, I had scheduled a therapy appointment (taking advantage of Mom's insurance which I qualified for when I moved in).

It was actually quite helpful, both for my stress, and for the fact that with me out of the picture, it forced Mom and Stepdad to fulfill their promise to Grandpa and take care of him while I was locked away. Boy were they pissed at me! Well fuck them for breaking a family promise.\n",
        "\n",
        "-A few weeks afterwards, I decided on a whim to apply for disability. A lot of people told me I'd be denied and it was useless to try, but I've always believed it never hurts to ask. After basically just telling them the truth about all my mental symptoms, they started sending me checks. Not much, but certainly more spending cash than I'd ever had before in my life.\n",

        "-With this money, I was able to buy my own desktop computer. I was able to get internet. I was able to post my art and stories online. I gathered a small amount of fans.

        "-Two of these friends, we'll call them Orange and Blue, eventually met each other through me. They took a liking to each other and fell in love. (They'd be married today if not for the fact that they're both guys.) Problem is, Blue was in the military. He'd already been abused to the point of PTSD by some of his higher-ups, and his emails and Skype calls to me and Orange were about the only things keeping him sane. His family, long story short, was not a source of support for him.\n",
        "\n",
        "-Then Blue got deployed to South Korea. Thousands of miles away from everything he knew and loved, and stuck with a bunch of people he did not mesh well with. Blue is a very independent thinker, and they do not do well in the military. He had some friends there, but plenty of other fellow soldiers just ground him down month after month.\n",
        "\n",
        "-One night, I get a Skype call. He has a bottle of sleeping pills. He needs me to give him a reason not to swallow them all. So I sit and talk with him all night long. He doesn't take the pills.\n",

At school the teachers tried to stop us talking about it, and we didn't really understand. That night, it was my grandma's 70th birthday which my family had prepared for for weeks.

I got it as a birthday gift but wouldn't have bought it for myself because it was $300.  I enjoyed it because I got to find out the gender 4 weeks before my doctor would have told me.  The 3D at that appointment just looked really weird.  The next appointment was at 21 weeks and looked just as weird but at least my daughter had more fat and didn't look as skeleton like.  The 3rd appointment was the best.  It was at 26 weeks and you could really tell her features.  The next appointment was at 31 weeks but she kept her face in the placenta the entire time so you couldn't see anything so they rescheduled me for 34 week and with that one she just looked really chubby and weird, almost nothing what she ended up looking like.  Each session came with a CD of pictures which I did look at and even used a picture for my baby shower invitations but I don't think I ever watched the 4D DVDs that came with each session (at no extra charge for either).  It was also cool to get pictures at each session (also at no additional charge) but and we used one in a frame of \"before and after\" pictures.  Other than that I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone unless they want to get an early gender or get a great deal on a 3D package around 26-28 weeks.  \n",

        "I also do not regret my child but I do regret who I had my child with. My ex got me pregnant on purpose because I was growing distant from him and would ask him sometimes if it would be better if we broke up. He used some very deep-seated personal issues I have to manipulate me into continuing to work on the relationship, even if for just a few weeks. He took that time to mess with my birth control and the condoms, and I found out I was pregnant a few days before my 20th birthday. He knew I'd never have an abortion (being an adopted child myself I just couldn't ever do it) and that'd buy him time to convince me to stay. Stayed with him until a little after our son's first birthday, but then the abuse became too much and we split. My ex knowingly has borderline personality disorder with sociopathic tendencies, and refuses to receive help or treatment, so you can probably easily imagine the kind of abuse that went on. Fast forward to around seven months after the split, and he completely abandons our son. Just walks out and vanishes without even so much as a warning. Fast forwarding to today and it has now officially been one year since he's seen our son. Didn't even call on our son's birthday or on Christmas. From what I've heard he's moved back to his old college town and drinks excessively all the time. While I realize it's for the best since he's severely unstable that he's not around our son, I still harbor a deep anger for what he did to my innocent little boy. My son is the happiest child I've ever met, and my life has been beyond blessed by his existence, but it is painfully difficult most days raising him on my own. I'm working, I'm going to school, I'm receiving no child support, I was diagnosed this year with both PTSD and schizoaffective disorder and struggling with those, I'm going to therapy weekly... I'm just *exhausted*. Exhausted, and also terrified. I'm trying so hard to be the best mother I can be to my son because he didn't ask for any of this and deserves happiness just like any child, but I'm afraid I'm going to fail him, or am failing him already, and that breaks my heart. I love my son so much and wouldn't trade having him for anything. I'm thankful that he's in my care and custody and that I have blessing of seeing him everyday. I just hope I won't fail him. \n",

Every time I've done it with my family, they've had a ball. I also make my own beef jerky with my dehydrator. If you guys live in a place with a yard, plant a garden. If not, get some planters and grow a little herb garden. Mint is a great one, she can make healthy tea. Find out about farmers markets and go there for fresh produce.

I love to cook and bake but because I'm in so much pain from last week (19th thru 23rd I was away from home, supporting my SIL like I mentioned) I just can't for probably the next month.  At least I have a crock pot so I can still have delicious, home cooked meals.  I also have a boyfriend that is completely doting and one of the most amazing persons in the world.  He doesn't mind sitting up with me late at night when I'm bawling because every time I start to fall asleep, my shoulders relax and send stabbing, shooting pain up to my temples, causing me to startle and wake up (and usually hurt myself more in the process).  And he likes to laugh at me when I'm having a good day and overestimate what I can do and try to pretend I'm a ninja and jump out of bed and hurt myself that way.\n",

The constant ache is at least gone, and the \"throb\" is weaker.  When I move too quickly or \"incorrectly,\" the stabbing, shooting pain is dulled .. although it still causes me to pause.  I can faintly feel the ache, going across my upper back, up to my temple (left side), and down my left arm.  My left side is typically my worse side, but sometimes it flip-flops.\n",

        "You should definitely try again. A similar thing happened to my parents. I don't know all of the details fully, as they don't really like to talk about it, but they lost their first child the day he was born. They had decided to get married after my mom had gotten pregnant, so there was definitely added anticipation around the birth. After he died, they were miserable. Like I said, they don't like to talk about it much, but I'm sure it was the worst time in both of their lives. They had to live in the house they had just bought for their new family, surrounded by reminders of the child they had lost. I can't imagine how that must have felt for them, but it seems like you're in a similar place. Though I know it still pains them, and though we still celebrate my brother's birthday (not by throwing a party or anything, just by spending the day together as a family), my parents are now immeasurably happier because they weren't deterred from having a family after losing their first child. They had me two years later, and three more in the 10 years after I was born. \n",
        "\n",
        "If you're worried about forgetting your daughter by having more children, I don't think you should be. In many ways, I think the opposite happens. By having more children, I think you'll understand and love your daughter more than you do now. When you look at your other children, at the ways they reflect both you and your husband and at the ways they grow to be their own people, you can better understand who your daughter would have been and why you love her, and why you would have loved her. The hardest part of losing a child at birth is, like you said, never having met her. I think having more children is the closest you can get to meeting your daughter. I never met my older brother, but I feel a connection to him. I've thought a lot about my relationship to him, and I think it comes down to this: my parents loved their son deeply, and when they lost him, they were devastated, because love is at the heart of despair. But it's not like their love evaporated. Love is an eternal thing. If they had never tried again, I think that love for their lost son would have been unbearable. Instead, my parents poured their love for my older brother into me and my sisters. Losing a child the way you did is a horrible tragedy, because while the child is gone, the love you have for that child cannot die. As long as its only object is your lost child, that love will be exclusively associated with pain. If you can redirect it in part towards living children, using the heartbreak as a perspective from which you can more deeply love your other children, the memory of your daughter will still be painful, but it will have a silver lining. I'm glad my parents chose to have children after my brother for selfish reasons, obviously, but I'm also glad they decided to because of what it means for my brother. I know he would not have wanted his death to be exclusively tragic. I think he would instead be happy that his younger siblings were more deeply loved and appreciated because of death.\n",

He found this very funny, and after taking me to the station to wait for my father to come pick me up, (he'd gotten my info from my Mountain Dew soaked wallet) gave me some advice I still remember today... \"Drugs are a dark highway, son.\" To which I responded, \"So...are cops like headlights...?\"\n",

My older brother has two children and my twin sister has three children.  If you cannot attend every single birthday party, baptism (I'm not religious, at all), or any other celebration you can think of, you are shunned as not having time for your family.  College was never a priority for anyone in my family, the routine (for a lack of better words) was graduate high school, get married, have children, buy a house within 10 miles of each other, and continue to work a job that requires you to live pay check to pay check.  \n",

For the few years we were still together after that she hated the fact that she Felt she couldn't celebrate anything on the day of her birthday.

That said I think he would say the that the best gift was his health that he was able to make the journey to the UK to celebrate with family. We would have of course gone out there if he couldn't make it, but he is fiercely independent...today when we did a little walk he refused to use the wheelchair he wanted to walk the entire circuit of the woods at the end he said \"what do you think of my walking.\" so I guess that tops the list.

        "Birthdays as our culture sees them, if you ask me, are pretty pointless, and rather selfish. It is, after all, simply a recognition of someone not dying for 365 / 366 days. If it should be recognized as anything, I feel like it should be seen as a moment to stop and say, \"You know what? It's hard to be alive, and the fact that I'm even OK is a pretty damn good accomplishment.\" From that perspective, I consider just how many people are far from OK, and barely feel justified in their right to exist. Given that, I feel like birthdays shouldn't be centered entirely on the individual, but the opposite: they should be a time to reflect on the fragility and transience of life, and each person's moral kinship obligation to their neighbor. It just feels so wrong to think that that goes ignored. But that's just my two cents. *steps off soapbox*\n",

Frequently in his old age he stressed that I should go to church, not for any particularly religious reasons (he never actually mentioned religion), but so you have a group of friends who will always be there.

        "An elderly neighbor stopped by today to wish me a happy birthday and have a cup of tea while we chatted. From previous conversations, he's learned that we have a common interest in coins and stamps and paper money. Much to my surprise he handed me a small envelope containing a 1901 Liberty $5 gold piece, in what looks to be VF condition.\n",

        "So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Anime store today behind a couple people that I know from when I went to Anime club in high school. It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my latest volume of the Attack on Titan manga. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who was trying to decide on what anime to buy. This struck me as odd as old people usually don't know anything about anime besides calling them \u201cChinese cartoons\u201d. It came to my realization that she was looking for a birthday present for her grandson. Now all these so called \u2018anime fans\u2019 were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my manga to the cashier, and said to the old lady \u201cHave you ever heard of Attack on Titan? You should buy some volumes of the manga for your grandson, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love it!\u201d One of the guys on the line (I knew these people, so I also knew that they had shit taste in anime) grabbed his friend and yelled very loudly, \"See that man? He\u2019s an otaku like us! I bet he watches Sword Art Online!\" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking a nice neckbeard, a shirt with an obscure anime reference written on it, and a trenchcoat, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said \"Like Sword Art Online? Ma'am I\u2019m half-Japanese who literally has the best taste in anime, and you attribute my god like taste of anime to someone who would watch such a terrible show like Sword Art Online? Your shit taste is cancer to us all.\" As I stormed out, a couple of the people in the store started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment.\n",

        "I work with mortgage loan officers.  As a processor who has supported sales for over 12 years,  I have seen a lot of different techniques.  Granted they sell mortgages but hey sales is sales right?  There is a need for your product or else you wouldn't be in business.   \n",
        "1. My rain makers, heavy hitters, big ballers whatever you want to call them know their products and know them well.\n",
        "2. They have found a niche market for their products.  (Specializing in a foreign language, catering to a special clientele or networking the heck out of a particular source)\n",
        "3. Only one out of 4 deals closes.  I hate killing a loan because that is my bonus too but they don't all work out.\n",
        "4. This sucks but it takes money to make money.  They market themselves by hosting open houses. they dress well and look very professional. They are out in public as the face of our bank. They carry themselves professionally 24/7.\n",
        "5. Go where the business is. My loan officers are rarely in the office.  They are at luncheons with realtors, chamber of commerce gatherings, sourcing out new builders... they network 24/7. \n",
        "6. Let others do the work for you. My best loan officers know how to work the tellers and personal bankers in the bank for referrals. The borrowers come into the branch to make their mortgage payment, hey call Sally and maybe she can lower your interest rate.  They come in to get a money order or cashier's check for rent, hey call Sally maybe she can prequal you for a home loan.  The tellers get a referral bonus from the bank and then it is perfectly legal for the loan officer to treat them to lunch. Referrals let others do the work for you.\n",
        "7. Follow up and follow through.  Successful sales people don't dump you once they have your business they follow up to see if your needs changed or your family status changed, send birthday cards... successfull people stay with you every step of the way.  That is how they build their book of business. \n",
        "\n",
        "I know easier said than done and it wasn't anything new. But in the mortgage market there are 100 other banks with 1000 other loan officers. The few that make it really take pride in their work and love it.  I am not sales. I love what I do. In two years I saw 18 new loan officers come and go through our branch. But the ones who are still making a healthy six figure salary today are the ones that have figured out their market. \n",

A week after that, we both broke up with our significant others. It was absolutely crazy at the time, but we were miserable with our ex's, and it took meeting each other to drive that point home. Since that day, my life has done a complete 180. I embraced my sexuality, I got a great job, I moved into an awesome apartment, and I applied to start college. I have never been this happy in my entire life--and it's all because I met a girl. :)\n",

        "I can't imagine being down at the weight you are now. I hope to one day be as strong and dedicated and get down there! Grats on your success! I don't know if any of what I say will help you but I'll throw it at you anyway, and if you can take something away from it, then awesome! If not, I will not consider it time wasted because everyone deserves every chance at being happy and relaxed. It seems like that's what you're missing the most actually. You're never able to unwind. Let go. Just be. I think that's going to be your key to happiness. I've always gained my confidence and relaxed strength through anger. It angers me when I imagine allowing someone to make my lunch uncomfortable, food I paid for, something that is of no concern to them. I tend to take that outlook on so many things. I mean, think about it... what the hell makes them better than you??? You have shown you have more motivation, more self control, more willpower, you have earned every right to stand up on a chair and sing Happy Birthday to yourself at the top of your lungs! You deserve that! You earned it, bud... You have to learn something in life. You picked a wonderful age to get muster the marbles to get your fitness on... You're 21 years old. You LITERALLY have your whole exciting adult life in front of you. You're at the transitioning phase anyway. You will soon realize that your life before age 21 is a blink in the scheme of things. The memories of your childhood and teenage years will be quickly and effortlessly replaced with more exhilarating adult memories. First loves and goofy camping trips, swimming and road trips, new friends and new hobbies and new adult everything. Before I go further, just want to let you know before you think this is weird. I'm 39, a woman, and I have 4 sons (20, 19, 16, and 14) and they are the most laid back, self assured kids you will ever meet... You deserve to be relaxed. You're giving them your power. You're giving them your peace. Get angry at yourself and if you need to, get angry at them! Don't yell at them, though, because a lot of it is your perception of stuff &gt;.&gt;... but if it makes you feel better to remind yourself that nobody deserves more than you and say it to yourself forcefully, get angry!(again, not at the people &gt;.&gt;) Another thing that might help... You're an intelligent guy, it's obvious from your post. Think logically about what you think the other person is thinking. Literally think about it. Ok, say for instance, the other people eating their pizza.... Honestly... do you honestly think they care what you ordered and are eating for dinner?? While they're chewing through their 4th slice of pizza or eating their second burger with barely a chew in between??? (I have sons, I know how you guys eat!) They don't care! And to be honest, it's probably more weird for them to see a 21 year old guy order a \"limp salad\" (your words, not mine! And not that there's anything wrong with a salad but I mean, it's not the first thing you think of a young guy eating!) Also, if you can honestly visualize and you truly believe a friend of yours is thinking something like that... Might wanna rethink that friendship... because he's kinda weird and cares a little too much about your meal choices... JUST SAYING :D OMG, this is so long but it hurts me so much to see a little guy with his whole life ahead of him, you should be walking 10ft above the ground! You did what 60% of the US would kill to do! Don't get too cocky, though... That crap is so unattractive... WHICH LEADS TO THE ISSUE THAT YOU THINK YOU HAVE WITH GIRLS... Let me give you a scenario... Your friends, who you assume are smooth as ice, and know all the right things to say and do... They learned what they know as teenagers... and were taught by female teenagers... Neither of those groups of people know ANYTHING about it... they might THINK they know... they might have you fooled into thinking they know more than you... I assure you, they don't... The simple fact that you care if you're good at all puts you ahead of them. They began under the impression that they had it all figured out, that they knew all the right moves... Those guys don't know anything... nothing... sorry guys &gt;.&lt; but it's true... The fact that you care means that you'll probably far surpass the guys who were little horndogs at 17, because more times than not, those guys only care about themselves and their needs. OK, let me wrap this up just in case none of this helps you &gt;.&lt; The clothes... dude... If I got down to a legit even 100lbs, I would not wear tight fitting clothes... I can't stand to see it on other people... wear what makes you comfortable! If you're comfortable pulling down a curtain in the living room and going out like Julius Caesar, you rock that shit! In the end, it all comes down to this... as much as you are worried about your clothes, as much as you're uncomfortable about eating in front of groups, as much as you think you're on display... you're not... because the thin cute girl at the next table didn't wax her eye brows today and she's busy trying to leisurely draw attention away from them which brings more attention to them, the guy sitting behind you thinks his girlfriend might be cheating on him(she probably isn't but we are all insecure and unsure of things... it's natural!)... The lady 2 booths down is sitting trying to have fun with her friends but in the back of her mind, she knows the meal she just purchased will leave her bill money short and she's trying to figure out which one she could get away with partially paying this month... the waiter has been on his feet for 4 hours now, hasn't had a  break while the waitress who is supposed to be helping with that portion of the restaurant is in the back flirting with the manager so she doesn't have to do work... and he's pissed!..... I COULD GO ON AND ON.... the point I'm trying to make to you, my young friend... is that all the attention that you feel is focused on you is 98% made up... The only attention you can truly count on is the attention from girls who find you cute... and guess what... the girls that you're politely turning down... they're walking away wondering what it was about them that you didn't like! I'm being honest... none of this is made up for your benefit... it's just the truth... oh... and that big woman casually dressed(not looking like one of The People of Walmart) over there in the back room with the full table of boys, laughing loudly as her kids take turns telling their unbelievably witty jokes... That's me! Not caring what you think but wishing you the best all the same :) This may not help you in the least, or maybe it will... I had fun writing it all the same, and I hope you let some of this sink in! And enjoyyyyyyyyyy your success! Go run around the block for me with your young healthy physique! I will live vicariously through you so I don't catch shin splints &gt;.&gt; Not safe for me to run yet... &gt;.&gt; BUT SOON! Enjoy life, it really ain't that bad &lt;3\n",

        "I actually think social media sites like facebook could be starting to lead us into a bit of a technology back-lash of sorts as the youth of today start to shun it.  There are many articles online about the demise of social media sites like facebook with the young.\n",
        "\n",
        "From my personal experience with young people at around 10 yrs old the internet and connected devices are seamlessly integrated into their play.  Want to make a costume?  Assemble graphics online, print them out, stick them on cardboard/clothes/etc.  Video yourself doing stunts on your scooter and share them online for all your class to see.  Get home and play minecraft with your friends online.  It's a toy extension.  They're using it socially, but not through 'social media' sites.\n",
        "\n",
        "Get to around 15 yrs old and things seem to change significantly.  They're on facebook, but so are their parents, teachers, and so on.  Being on facebook for teenagers is not cool at all, and will soon be socially frowned upon if it isn't already.  At this age they're instant messaging more than anything, from what I understand they're not usually on sites like reddit.com quite yet.\n",
        "\n",
        "A bit older and sites like reddit.com where you can be anonymous and socialise in a variety of niche areas is significantly more popular.  People use it for fun and serious things, but almost always anonymously.\n",
        "\n",
        "Older still, and facebook is popular with people keeping in touch with their families/friends as they start their own family.  One of the things of becoming a parent is that if you're at home looking after the children, you have significant number of small chunks of time spare and a longing for social interaction, so things like facebook fit perfectly into that slot.\n",

        "So, it's hard to see where it's going as each generation is using the technology differently and that'll continue to evolve in complex ways.  There could also be new technologies that open up new avenues (VR + Fibre, AR + 5G, etc.) for remote socialising.  Socialising remotely might even be shunned as something 'boring grown-ups' do, with instant messages being used just to organise face-to-face meetings.\n",
        "\n",
        "I think sites like facebook are dead, they just don't know it yet (or more likely, they do and are desperately fighting it rather than adapting).  I'm not quite sure what will replace them, perhaps something like reddit that's more geographically/friend centric.  Or maybe they'll just leave social media alone completely, perhaps coming back when they're older to anonymous sites.  Another thing could be the rise of friends on services like Xbox Live/PSN, they could start to form the base of the next social media wave (this is even happening to me to some extent already, I have several friends I see 'in-game' more than in person).  The 'looking up old friends' aspect will likely spin right back to where it started with dedicated sites like friends reunited.\n",

That's why I've come all the way here, to find out what you've been up to!\"  The conversation instantly became much better from that point on, we weren't all doing the usual daily \"Did you watch blah?

        "Last night I was invited over to a friends house for a party type thing normally I don't go because they're all hardcore tweakers and I don't really enjoy the stuff but always end up spun somehow and uncomfortable as fuck. So I get there with my current girlfriend set my stuff down take off my hoodie and toss it. It was weirdly cold last night so I rocked this hoodie my brother had gotten me as a birthday gift and I fucking love the thing. So everyones hanging out and having a good time and doing the party thing and then I kind of over here some people talking about how this couple has shown up uninvited and how they were straight scum junkies. You know the stereotypical movie junkies i.e steal clothes from a store do a return cop with like 8 bucks, steal from you help you look for YOUR shit sell it then cop from YOU with the money they made off of it. This is a pretty common M.O for them I guess, I only know the guy and it's only from a AA meeting I had gone too a long time ago the girl I have no fucking clue who she is. They show up and everyone clenches their packs and things tighter than a racist women in the south with tupac on a elevator ya know. I make sure to keep track of my digi,dope,money and other things. At one point they both bounced the party went one and kind of died out. It came down to me, the owner of the house(J huge tweaker) my friend and some random people and my girlfriend all hanging out in the living room. All of the sudden someone was BANGING on the front door not like a regular knock but you know the 'Cop Knock', like that. Now I don't know how fast hussain bolt is but I think that if you ever cop knock on a meth houses front door those guys will move quicker than he could ever hope too. It's that chick again, sobbing her fucking eyes out. She was completely incoherent so we yank her inside because the last thing we need is some junkie chick crying screaming and carrying on, on the front porch of a semi-trap house in a fucking apartment complex of all things. So she comes in and I do my check again grab my shit pile it put it away and hide things because I'm getting all kinds of bad jojo from her and I've a couple of stories already about this bitch. I grab the D,money,digi bags and boxes I keep them in throw them in my pack and put it behind the chair I had been sitting in that was against a wall so it was pretty safe. But I had forgotten to watch some of my other shit. The night goes on I'm completely fucked the owner of the house is walking in circles tweaking the fuck out talking about something or other that didn't make logical sense so I grab my buddy I came with, my girl,all of my shit and hit the fucking door ASAP(unstable psychosis tweaking scares me no lie). As I'm looking for my shit I notice my hoodie is MIA and am in such a hurry to get the fuck away from J that I don't really spend much time looking for it. The next day I wake up call J and he's still awake (going on day 7 so he says but no one really knows how long 3-7 days seem to be the common agreement) and is fucking OUT OF IT. What ever no big deal I'll stop by later and look for my hoodie and some other random little things. I get a couple calls make a couple things happen and then this kid B shows up at my hotel. We're shooting the shit and I mention how I had forgotten my hoodie at J's and was pissed I couldn't get it and so on. I then mention that bitch. His face goes blank and he goes \" listen man my cousin works at platos closet and that chick is in there all the time selling stolen stuff want me to call and see if she jacked it\" I start putting two and two together and relieze that I had left it by a chair in the same room she had been in when she and her dude bounced the first time and hadn't noticed it since. I was really distracted everyones dry as fuck there so I was talking to a ton of people. He makes the call I describe the hoodie and as sure as fuck it's there. This bitch straight jacked my fucking shit. What. A. Cunt. So we ask when she's going to be back and told they don't know however shes has from 45mins-12hours to pick the money up for what ever they took. We decide that we are going to catch this bitch straight in the act of selling my stolen shit and snatch it the fuck back man. I'm fucking heated by this point. I was nothing but nice to this girl all night when she was all upset and stuff I even helped her get a $8 bag from the dog at the party. Normally he would of told her to fuck off get 2 more bucks at least and get a point and so on. But he felt bad her boyfriend got knocked fucked his money up and helped her out even making sure it was a straight .08. This bitch really is going to fuck the dog over like that though? So we hop in the car head the fuck out to the Platos Closet where this bitch has taken my hoodie and it turns out she's pretty well known in that store because she's homeless as fuck and stays well by selling stuff at that store. We hang around for a bit and while were there J calls me. He wants to come by for a bit so I arange for him to swing by my hotel room and have my buddy talk to him ya know. I tell my buddy to see if this chick is with him or not. 20 mins goes by my friend calls she isn't with him and so we say fuck it we're going straight to J's our self. J's house is a straight homeless flop house for homeless junkies and tweakers alike. I feel bad because he's a nice kid and these cockroaches take advantage of him and his house and eat his food but that's another story. We head up to J's the logic is, if that bitch isn't there we're sure there will be some homeless bum scum that would know where she is. We get there walk into the living room....and there she fucking is. Sleeping. Happy. High. She's fallen asleep on this enlongated chair type thing that seems to be the bastard child of a couch and one of those 1920s fainting chairs. I wake over take a deep breath and kick the ever living fuck out of........the chair( come on dude I'm not going to hit a girl thats fucked regardless of what the situation is). She wakes up shocked as fuck and before she can ever get a word in I begin to yell. Not really yell just talk very very sternly and loudly and with no hint of compassion in my voice. \"You stole my fucking hoodie, you have it at platos closet, you're going to get your fat scummy ass the fuck on up, get in our car go down there and get it the fuck out, RIGHT FUCKING NOW\" at first she's completely compliant saying shit like \"okay okay yeah no problem yeah\" and nodding her head but this is just the shock of being woken up like that. But as she wakes up she begins to tell me I'm full of shit. \"I didn't do it\" \"I don't have it\" blah blah blah blah lie lie lie lie. I tell her surprise bitch I was just at that platos and saw it with my own two eyes and guess what YOUR FUCKING NAME IS ON THE TAG ITS CHECKED IN UNDER. You dumb dumb junkie theif. I walk out side shes going on and on about how \"I better never come at her like dat again or she gunna beat my little ass doe\". Yeah yeah whatever bitch just get in the car already. I decided to hang back because if I rode with she'd just get extra heated or I would and things would of gone by. My dude and her hop in the car take off and as they pull off I can still hear her going on about how \"I'm a punk bitch\" and \"Whys he lyin on me like dat\" etcetc. I hang around this house and kind of notice how run down it is...man these kids have fucked J's house up. It's dirty there's speed bags everywhere. No one looks like they've slept in hours and at least 5 people asked me if the dog would front them because they get a check from their cousins grand ma's best friend friday for 6million bucks and they're going to have it then but need to have someone else cash it because they don't have a I.D. I go out back smoke a cig and they pull up. He's driving past me and we lock eyes and I just smile smile and smile. Got ya bitch fucking got your ass. She gets out my dude forces her to be the one to hand it back over to me I start to hop in the car she stops and turns around and goes in a somber defeted voice \"ey mane can I say sumtin two ew\". I look out the window as I begin to shut the door and tell her \"fuck no you can't you can never say shit to me again. you're a theif and scum\" as we pull away I lean out and say \"Oh not only are you a theif but you're a liar too\" I felt like the james bond of Pac Sun hoodies, a DEA agent of finding junkie thieves lit a cig and rolled on back to the hotel room and did a shot. Today was a interesting day.\n",

Now for the motivation part think of something where you see a new you whatever you're working on whether biceps or chest. If you work on abs trust me you'll see results really quick. the best thing for motivation is how are people going to look at you in the future as they see you from today. It takes a while and patience, but guarantee people see you differently and they see your progress. Imagine few months in the future or years and people say dude you look totally different. You can ask for dumbbells or whatever equipment for your birthday or a holiday, but it's ok to feel uncomfortable. I still feel uncomfortable when I go to the gym, but I remember I can't let that hinder me. I'm becoming a stronger and healthier person and a better me. And these guys were just like me.

The sight of her laying here asleep, almost looked like a work of art. I saw goosebumps cover her naked body from the low temperature of the hotel room. The acid formed a barrier of oscillating colors around her. I stood back up, grabbed my gun, unloaded it, and returned it to it\u2019s case. I grabbed my duffle bag and slung it over my shoulder. I entered the kitchen and flipped on the coffee maker. I looked around the room for my keys a found them on the side table under the canopy of the bedside lamp, resting on top of my custom leather gloves.

I had absolutely no idea, i had the a perfect pregnancy, he was developing normally, hitting all of his milestones, we saw absolutely no abnormalities. After his first mri we found out about 70% of his entire right side of his brain missing. A few weeks following the dx, he started having seizures (infantile spasms) which made his entire development deplore. The seizures caused complete universal development delay, left side hemi plegia and hemi paralysis, he did not use his entire left side of his body. He was no longer babbling, trying to crawl, he was like an empty shell. All progress was lost and damaged his body physically. He would have large clusters of these seizures, once 100 within 15 minute period. All I could do was hold him and cry with him in between. Luckily I caught the seizures early and we started him on medication ASAP, within two weeks of being on it his seizures stopped. \n",

I was not going to let this define who he is or who he will become. a few weeks after his 3rd birthday I got to see his first steps, several months ago I heard the words I love you from his lips and it made my whole world complete. Our journey the past four years has not been easy, but I am so goddamn proud and grateful to be his mother. Being a special needs parent is not easy but you learn to appreciate everything more.

        "Ok so for some context: I'm an only kid with slightly overprotective parents. I'm not a US native and I moved to the NE 3 years ago for higher education. More context (bear with me, relevant to the story): My birthday is on the 26th of December, and in 2004 it was the day of the tsunami that killed ~250,000 people. I happened to be near the beach that day, chilling in my grandparents' (thankfully empty at the time) beach house and only avoided becoming another victim by the skin of my teeth. My parents have been even more protective of me since that close shave.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before I moved to the NE, I'd never seen snow before in my life. So what do I decide to do for my first winter vacation? That's right, rent a crappy FWD car and drive to NYC. This is around Christmas (24th to 26th) and since my birthday falls on the 26th my friends and I decided to do a combo celebration on Christmas day and drive back north on the 26th. That was the day of this huge-ass snowstorm, if anyone recalls, and it happened to hit exactly at the time we were traveling back. None of our party realized the destructive potential of a snowstorm and so we didn't heed the weather forecasts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, I'm a reasonably good driver (I did some rallycross in my home country and I can handle a car in some nasty conditions). But nothing had prepared me (nor my friends) for what we saw that day. What we assumed would be relatively comfortable 4.5 hr drive turned into a 13 hour ordeal that I've not told my parents about till date. All of us were naive enough to think that we'd be able to handle the road conditions (the storm got really bad about ~2 hours into our journey) and get home before the worst happened. On top of it all, I lost my brand new iPhone when we stopped for gas, presumably fell out of my pocket as I was getting in/out, and I couldn't have contacted anyone in an emergency. Even today, my 3 friends and I shake our heads at our dumbfuckery in deciding to continue driving that day. We tried pulling off the highway at 2 maybe 3 exits but got our car stuck in the un-ploughed snow all 3 times and I think that's what prompted us to keep going. The last 50 miles were complete agony as we got stuck behind an 18 wheeler and I didn't have the nerve to overtake in near zero visibility. Only the rumble strips and some creative navigating kept us on the road.\n",

        "End of story - we got back home 13 hours later, everything thankfully intact, with this huge pile of accumulated snow on the back of the rental (which we later realized had been obscuring the brake lights).

I am a warlock basically. I have 3 pets always out protecting me and only die when I'm ridiculous and try to kill something that I shouldn't. I'm only lvl 20 so far. However I am very happy you are alright, I was starting to wonder about you. I will be out Fri-Sun. It's the weekend before my boyfriend's birthday and we are going out to have some fun. As much as we can with our work schedules. We got a sofa today :) His family finally moved out and we basically gave half our house to them so we got new plates, sofa, bed, etc. Our cats are freaking out cause the movers came with a giant box.

I swear I can smell the old man's hands on it, a mixture of the pipe tobacco he smoked out in the shed and a biscuity smell that permeated the whole house when I would go visit. I loved that smell.

        "Secondly, this kind of a protest doesn't have anywhere near enough real support among the fans to succeed. Boards like this one give a false view of how people really feel. Every other post is an ennui-soaked rant about how we are going to hell in a handbasket, the manager is senile, the players are shit, and the board is indifferent. Yet they tune in dutifully every week to watch the football.\n",

In that video he claims to work with money (going from memory I think he claims to be an accountant at a largish company), and uses information on publicly-listed corporations to make a point (which he does in this video as well). In both cases the information he uses doesn't really apply to his argument; and is somewhat obscure to someone who doesn't read the business section of the paper. This is a rhetorical device.

From what I have read about Gazidis and his role in the club (which to be fair isn't much, as I'm sure you've gathered I don't spend much time worrying about how the club is run) a large part of his job is securing commercial deals. This is an extremely important part of maintaining competitiveness for top-level football clubs in today's environment. It's extremely important for the Arsenal, as we are coming to the end of the under-paying long-term deals we entered into in exchange for cash upfront to build the new stadium. We are entering into new kit deals and new sponsorships to redress the balance and make us more competitive with the likes of ManU and Bayern Munich. It's possible that Gazidis was paid a bonus for his performance in securing those deals. In which case, it seems less objectionable.\n",

It was cold in the morning and I sat down on the step outside of the garage, elbows on my knees, chin resting on my hands. A lady came by and thought I was a doll (literally). She was closely inspecting me for the condition and looking for a price tag. She reached out and touched me and I moved. She jumped back and screamed.

        "So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Anime store today behind a couple people that I know from when I went to Anime club in high school. It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my latest volume of the Attack on Titan manga. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who was trying to decide on what anime to buy. This struck me as odd as old people usually don't know anything about anime besides calling them \u201cChinese cartoons\u201d. It came to my realization that she was looking for a birthday present for her grandson. Now all these so called \u2018anime fans\u2019 were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my manga to the cashier, and said to the old lady \u201cHave you ever heard of Attack on Titan? You should buy some volumes of the manga for your grandson, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love it!\u201d One of the guys on the line (I knew these people, so I also knew that they had shit taste in anime) grabbed his friend and yelled very loudly, \"See that man? He\u2019s an otaku like us! I bet he watches Sword Art Online!\" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking a nice neckbeard, a shirt with an obscure anime reference written on it, and a trenchcoat, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said \"Like Sword Art Online? Sir I\u2019m half-Japanese who literally has the best taste in anime, and you attribute my god like taste of anime to someone who would watch such a terrible show like Sword Art Online? Your shit taste is cancer to us all.\" As I stormed out, a couple of the people in the store started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment.\n",

        "Cheese balls are one of my all-time favorite foods. I always seem to meet the most interesting people when I'm around them, too. In fact, cheese balls bring to mind the time I met Bob Barker, star of the most popular morning game show. He's an emcee, a host, and a celebrity all rolled into one. Anyway, eight months ago -- it was Tuesday the 17th, I believe -- or it might have been the 18th ... no, no, it was definitely the 17th, because it was precisely one week after my aunt Lucretia's birthday, which is the 10th. Aunt Lucretia's quite a woman. Loves to cook. She prepares a fabulous war shu a. That's a Chinese duck dish. I love Chinese food. I once went to a party where they served Chinese food and cheese balls. Now that was a Catch-22 situation. Catch-22 was a movie, you know. It was long, very long. They say the book was better, but it was a novel and I never finish reading those things. Of course, a lot of people don't read much nowadays. They watch television. I caught a program on PBS last night. A very good show on chimpanzees in the media. They had a clip of J. Fred Muggs, the chimp from the TODAY show. But it was Fred's chimpanzee girlfriend that had me stumped. I couldn't remember her name, so I looked it up. Her name was Phoebe B. Beebe. Anyway, as I was saying, eight months ago, Tuesday the 17th, I went downtown on a nice, relaxing stroll. I love to relax. In fact, relaxing is a pastime of mine. Some people play golf. Others like tennis, horseshoes, bridge, canasta, and other such fancy hobbies. Now, another hobby enjoyed by many is knitting. My grandmother was a great knitter. Knitted this sweater I'm wearing. It's red, which is not my favorite color. I prefer mauve or mustard yellow. Now, don't get me wrong: red is okay for ties and suspenders, but with sweaters I prefer more neutral colors. But when I'm relaxing, I don't care what I wear: long pants, Bermuda shorts, T-shirts, or formal attire. You name it, anything goes. Now, on the 17th, during my relaxing stroll, I recall wearing my herringbone jacket, my Laughlin, Nevada, souvenir tie, and my charcoal gray slacks. Or was it the navy slacks? Oh, I suppose it doesn't really matter. What matters is comfort. You know, I love comfort. It goes along with that pastime of mine, relaxing. Now, for me, there is nothing more relaxing than a nice leisurely stroll, like the one I took eight months ago on the 17th. It was a bright, sunny day, which of course is the optimum condition for relaxed strolling. And as I walked along, I found myself humming a haunting melody. I kept humming and humming and humming and humming. I couldn't get the tune out of my head. I racked my brains to come up with the title, but to no avail. You see, I'm not terribly musical. And yet, I'd always wanted to play an instrument and be like my musical hero, Leo Sayer. But who can compete with Leo? I think I was just scared that I'd fail. Well, I decided right then and there to go buy a musical instrument. So on the particular Tuesday the 17th to which I was referring, I went down to the Sixth Street Music Emporium to buy a new tambourine, a terribly soothing instrument, contrary to popular opinion. And as I was strolling along, I detected a wonderful scent in the morning air. \"What could it be?\" I asked myself. So I went toward that marvelous scent, distracted by its aroma from my musical mission. The odor was a mix of orchid flowers and bologna, which of course is one of the world's most under-appreciated luncheon meats. That and pimento loaf. I love a good pimento loaf and mayo sandwich -- the more pimentos, the better. Why, just the mention of pimentos makes my taste buds stand up and say, \"Howdy.\" Now there's an interesting word: \"Howdy.\" Is it from \"How are you\" or maybe \"How you doing\"? \"Howdy\"'s one of those strange words that really has no origin. I like saying \"How do\" more than \"Howdy\" -- more formal, I think. Not too flowery. But the flowery aroma of that particular morning carried me on my fragrant quest. Now, the smell was actually less bologna and more orchid -- the beautiful flower found on the island state of Hawaii. Of course, I wasn't in Hawaii, so I needed to search out the location of the nearest orchid. So, I visited every florist shop in town. Well, to make a long story short, not a single flower shop in town had any orchids in stock, which seemed mighty curious to me. Now, as we all know, curiosity killed the cat, but since I'm not a feline, I wasn't too worried. Felines are funny creatures, don't you think? I had a cat once. It used its claws to tear my living room couch to shreds. It was a comfy couch, too. Had a sleep-away bed in it with a foam rubber mattress. Now, I bought the couch and the mattress at Levine's Department Store on Third Avenue, the very same afternoon of that relaxing stroll aforementioned. I also bought myself a lovely tambourine on that same shopping expedition. Anyway, I didn't want to pay extra for the delivery of the couch, so I decided to carry the couch home myself. It was quite cumbersome. And getting it through the store's revolving doors was a bit of a challenge. And just as I emerged onto the street, by accident I bumped into a well-dressed man with an orchid in his lapel. It was Bob Barker, and he was eating a bologna and cheese balls sandwich. Well, it's been nice chatting with you. \n",

        "I was in my first year in an American school after moving from Saudi Arabia, and it was my 13th birthday.  I believe school had started the previous week.  I had just moved over with my Mother, my Father was still over there working.  Both of my parents are \"pure bred\" American, from the South, but I was born and raised in Saudi Arabia.  I had understood the gulf war, had to be evacuated previously due to it, was told of the Khobar bombings just a few miles from the camp my family lived in.\n",

Haven't they been attacked?  How many people can be in those towers?  Are those offices or a giant hotel..?\" basically, I knew nothing of the twin towers, even less about New York, and didn't grasp what it meant to those around me.  I also had made only a couple acquaintances, none of which even knew it was my birthday, let alone my past.\n",

I was accused of being a terrorist or being a 'towel head' (again, I am white as the driven snow, both parents from Southern U.S. with their parents from the same) and spent the two years of middle school with that and 'fatty' being the two main insults thrown at me.

You can do this! Look that social anxiety in the face and take little steps each day. And learn to say \"Things will be better in ________\" for me it's my birthday.

My friend's parents were gone for the night, and she decided to force a major house party for her birthday, while her parents told her deliberately not to do that. Beer pong, blasted music, people coming in and out; the usual underage, alcoholic activities. Of course, the cops came, and stormed the house. Issuing tickets to everyone who chose not to run or hide, which was mostly everyone. Some jumped the fence, but were caught. The house happened to be in the downtown suburbs and there were plenty of officers on sight. Two hid in the attic. But, for hours, dozens of teenagers lined up to receive brusque questions and public intoxication tickets.\n",

I froze, and looked around, there was a loveseat in the corner, where behind it you could sit behind and hide. I thought it was an, obvious, and bad hiding spot, and that I would surely be discovered, but I had already got a PI not long ago, and I already had other tickets weighing on me, so I REALLY could not get caught. \n",

Except for me behind the couch and my friend who was hiding in the attic, upstairs. There were 2 incidences, where an officer briefly, looked behind my couch, then went away. I'm a skinny guy, and only 5'8\", I was able to press myself against its back for more concealment. However, if someone actually, directly looked down, I could be seen. I loathed it would not come to that.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next hour were teenagers assembling in a line through the living room, and I heard a lot of chatter, shuffling, phones ringing, girls crying, questions and commands from the police, and parents arriving. I heard the birthday girl, crying and detained the longest, forced to call the house owners (her parents) who were only an hour today. The police gathered everyone's name -- names of all the people everyone person came with -- once the cops had all the name they took an inventory. The missing names led to more searches until those people were found. I heard everything. And when they found the stragglers, and regrouped in the living room, I heard my name being shouted by police officers and the people who knew me, \"Ryan! Where's Ryan? Who knows Ryan? Ryan, come out, we know where you are. Ryan, just come out.\" Then, My red-headed friend started dialing his phone, after confessing to an officer. The next thing I knew, my phone starts ringing in my pocket. I scrambled, and panicked, as I struggled to get my hand in my pocket and silence it. After a full ring, I found the power button on the outside of my jeans, and silenced it. And listened. I heard no footsteps coming toward my area, in the corner. No one seemed to notice it at all. \n",

I thought about just pissing my pants, but then I thought, if I got caught anyway, I would be the guy standing in line, who pissed his pants. It wasn't worth it. Then, I saw a blanket hanging above me, and I pulled it down unnoticed. I bundled it in the corner, and then, well you know, proceeded to release at an angle, hoping the small blanket would soak up most of it. I had to piss for much longer than I wanted to. And the corner began to reek with urine, the stench was just as unbearable. You never really know how bad urine smells, until you sit next to it. \n",

This was it. I should have just gave myself up earlier, before pissing in the corner of my friend's living room. The cop was horrified by the stench, he dared not come closer, nor actually look to find me. He stepped back, complaining about how awful it smelt in the corner. Other cops wondered close by my hiding spot, looking, but keeping their distance.\n",

        "I released enough pee to not cause me to go insane. Then, my phone rang again, and I cursed myself for not completely turning off my phone the first time. This time, the caller was my friend who was in the attic. Luckily, no officers were in the room in that window of time, or I would have been found. I answered the phone and told him where I was, I soon regretted that. He told my other friends, and they knew where I was, all it would take to expose me, would be some curiosity or an admittance from one them. Some of my friends considered giving me up, jealous that they were getting tickets, and I was 10 feet away, hiding behind the couch, laughing at them. Thankfully, my friends stayed true.\n",

What is that smell? I decided to wait until they went in another room, then sneak out the front door, it wasn't far away. But, my friend from the attic came down, and told me the parents where I was. The dad looked over the couch and found me, and I stood up scared shit-less. They were nice to me, and got me a bottled water. I decided not to tell them I pissed in their house, for fear they would call the cops back. I waited until later to tell everyone I pissed in their house. I should have kept that a secret, and just let everyone think I am amazing Ann Franke, ninja. But the fact that I pissed in the corner of a house took away any dignity or respect to be had in my escape. It was still better than going to jail. \n",

Will I be best served putting that in 401k? No. I take it out and now have to pay the taxes I deferred previously as well as penalty tax. Will I be best served putting that in a bank account? No. I don't need it today and I'd like it to make a return in the interim.\n",

        "Another way of putting it, consider the liquidity vs. return of return scale. 401k - low liquidity, (hopefully) higher rate of return. Bank account - very high liquidity, much smaller rates of return. Normal stock account - Moderate liquidity, medium to high rates of return.\n",

        "Lots and lots of playtime and \"mind melters\". Work on training(we have videos on our YouTube channel in the sidebar, get started today), get some puzzle toys, play hide and seek, run around the house like an idiot and play tag. While you're running around, tie a toy to a piece of sturdy rope and drag it. That'll help keep her focused on the toy instead of you, and it's a safe distance from your hands. Any other puppies around? Friends with puppy tolerant healthy adult dogs? Puppy play group? Kindergarten? Get there, and quick. Especially for your pup, it's well worth the money you might spend. \n",

If she does get your hand, drop the toy, stand up, walk away. Don't need to say a word, actually, no words is better. *Completely* ignore her. You might have to endure some nips on your feet, but **don't you move**! That terrier in her will make her try extra hard to engage you, don't do it! Watch our nipping and biting video and see how long it takes for the pup, a pit mix, so tenacious terrier, to give up and wander off from biting my hair. Pretty damn long when you're the one getting chomped on! But, she does get bored and give up eventually. That's what you're waiting for. And it will happen, just gotta wait her out. \n",
        "\n",
        "So during your tug playing, she nips, you get up and walk away. When she finally gets bored and gives up, you can go back to the toy and start playing again. That's her reward. Playing nicely gets more playing, being bitey gets her nothing. Puppies really don't like nothing. \n",

Teething will come soon, so be prepared with teething toys, frozen, broth dipped, rolled washcloths, and ice cubes so she doesn't backslide.

The band's best known lineup consisted of Vaden Todd Lewis (guitar, vocals) Mark Reznicek (drums), Lisa Umbarger (bass), and Clark Vogeler (guitar). When the band reformed in 2006, Umbarger amicably declined to participate and has been replaced by Doni Blair. They are best known for the hit single \"Possum Kingdom,\" from their album Rubberneck. This song was named after Possum Kingdom State Park, in Palo Pinto County, Texas. ([more on last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/Toadies))|  \n",

Also, do not walk around the ground hoping for tickets as you are just begging to get stung by touts who will overcharge you and have also been known to sell fake tickets. My advice would be to follow @arsenal_tickets on twitter. It is a very active fan-to-fan, face value ticket sharing system where many season ticket holders, myself included, put their tickets for sale if they are unable to make the game. If you keep a close eye on the account, you can find tickets for every game. Also, the Facebook 'Arsenal tickets' page can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2230322824/.

        "My company sells to hundreds of non-profit tax exempt organizations each month. Currently we do NOT have to collect tax exempt forms from our customers that reside outside of Minnesota. We only have nexus in Minnesota; therefore, we are not required to charge sales tax on the transactions outside of Minnesota. Avalara is one of the certified software providers that are supposed to provide FREE software to calculate the sales tax (if the Marketplace Fairness Act passes). The software to calculate the sales tax might be free (subsidized by the taxpayer) but exemption certificate management is not included in the wording of the pending legislation. It is NOT free and it would be very expensive. My company has two employees (my wife and I). It would be impossible for us to manage exemption certificates without being forced to buy into expensive software. If the MFA passes all of our online orders to sales tax exempt organizations will result in telephone calls or email where they will ask us to remove the sales tax. It will be a major time issue when we are a 2 person company to collect certificates and change sales receipts. Then we will have to log into our website and list the customer as tax exempt for future orders. What takes us 30 seconds now to process an order will take us an additional 10 minutes per exempt order to respond to the customer, get the certificate, file it, go online and change them to an exempt customer. There is nothing FREE or STREAMLINED about the exemption certificate process. Avalara even writes there are, \u201cNO universal rules on tax-ability or exemptions.\u201d In my opinion, the states have a long way to go on their streamlined rules that would be required under the pending legislation. This legislation would hinder Interstate commerce if it is passed.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition it will cost us about $20,000 to integrate the FREE tax software mentioned in the legislation into our websites. The software is supposedly free but it only plugs into some of the shopping carts on the market. The business owner must then pay to have it installed and map all of their items to a state run database to determine taxability.\n",
        "\n",
        "We sell alot of procuts to the elderly population. Many of our sales are telephone orders. Currently we only have to calculate one sales tax for the items we sell. If the legislation passes we will have to calculate the taxability of each item based on zip code. Some products are taxable, some are not, it depends on where the item will ship. Some states tax shipping some do not. If a customer calls and orders lets say 15 different items my wife will have to determine the taxability of each item. What normally would take 3 minutes on a phone order will take her 15 minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also many seniors do order via traditional mail order. We do still get checks in the mail. I think Amerimark said they receive well over 1 million mail orders a year. This legislation will require the person that is ordering by mail to write the check for the correct tax. Again, some items have a tax and some do not depending on the state, county, city, indian tribe, etc...It would be nearly impossible to put an insert into a traditional mail order catalog that would cover over 9,600 different taxing jurisdictions. \n",

In the fall of that year, at the age of just 16, he gained popularity for his award-winning remix of The Island by Pendulum which was praised by the likes of Skrillex and Pendulum front-man Rob Swire.

As far as ceiling is concerned, Teague is probably near it, but if you compare his performance this season to reasonable expectations, it was a nice year for the young point guard.\n",
        "\n",
        "I was worried about Jeff when he wanted us to not match the Bucks offer, but he's turned around and he seems to be excited to play in Atlanta again. The fans love and appreciate him and I hope he realizes that. Jeff can get a little flustered on the court sometimes, but he always gives his best.\n",

        "\n",
        "I might as well get the negative typical Josh Smith related stuff out of the way first so. He posted his always-balanced defensive numbers (8.4 rebounds, 1.8 blocks, 1.2 steals per game), but on the offensive end, it was a bit of a mess. His 46% field goal percentage was woefully under what it should be, and his free-throw numbers (52%) were disastrous. Much of Smith\u2019s inefficiency can be tied back to his sometimes-atrocious shot selection, and while we could be here for days, I will simply point out that he took *career-high* 201 three-point attempts (30.3%) and a staggering 3.8 long, two-point attempts between 16-23 feet per game (31.6%).\n",
        "\n",
        "As far as the positives go, Smith turned himself into a defensive stopper at times during the season. His on-ball defensive numbers were the best of his career on the perimeter, and Larry Drew\u2019s decision to deploy him on Paul George in the Indiana series made the match-up much, much competitive. In the end, Smith was (as always) a very valuable player. I love Josh Smith and he's part of the reason I personally became a Hawks fan. I wish him the best in Detroit and I hope the Atlanta crowd will realize how much he's done for us when he plays at Philips in the following season.\n",

        "\n",
        "When Kyle Korver was acquired from the Bulls (for virtually nothing, by the way), it was seen as a fantastic move league-wide. Korver has a reputation for being one of the game\u2019s best shooters, and on a team starving for outside accuracy, his acquisition was a God-send.\n",
        "\n",
        "Korver finished 2nd in the NBA in three-point percentage (46%), 4th in total three-pointers made, and did so without taking anything off the table. No one in the league is better at coming off of screens and/or knocking down kick-out jump shots, and it\u2019s a pleasure to see him shoot. His shooting displays are the stuff of legend, but it was really the ability to play better defense than I thought (and most people thought) that made Korver infinitely more valuable than I had previously believed. With the exception of Paul George, Korver proved to be more than \u201cjust\u201d a shooter throughout the year, creating his own offense at times, and providing league-average defense.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another fan favorite that every Hawks fan is happy to have back. If you've watched a Hawks game, you've seen Kyle shoot. If your team has played against Hot Sauce, you've groaned everytime he got an open shot. He's Kyle Korver and he's here to stay!\n",

        "**Zaza \"Nothing Easy\" Pachulia**\n",
        "\n",
        "The love affair that Hawks fans/pundits have with Zaza is well-documented. He is the clear fan favorite, and with his hard-nosed/aggressive play, you can certainly see why. On the court this year, Zaza produced just about what you would expect (6 points per game, 7 rebounds per game, 47% field-goal percentage), and when he exited for the season with a blown achilles, it was a huge blow an already-depleted front line.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many teams that would *love* to have Pachulia as a \u201cthird big\u201d, and he provided Larry Drew with the ability to move Al Horford out of the 5-spot freely when needed. He certainly isn\u2019t a star and he\u2019s probably not even a legitimate starting center, but the loss of Pachulia was felt in a huge way when Johan Petro was forced into action in the playoffs on Roy Hibbert. It is not unreasonable to think that Pachulia\u2019s impact could have changed the complexion of a game or two in the playoffs, and for that, his absence will be remembered.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the words of Zaza, \"nothing easy\", and I wish him more than the best in Milwaukee. We love you, Zaza, you magnificent beast.\n",

        "**Devin Harris**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Marvin Williams-for-Devin Harris move would\u2019ve been a fantastic one even if Harris was terrible. Williams was owed nearly $17 million for 2 years, and Utah inexplicably flipped Harris\u2019 similar one-year contract for Williams straight-up. That was a fantastic coup for Ferry even before the season began.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the court, Harris was solid, but unspectacular. Gone are days when he was a 20+ point scorer (21 ppg average in 2008-2009 with New Jersey), and he was stuck in a difficult position on the roster. Harris is a guy who needs the ball in his hands to be effective, and he was often deployed a slot-in shooting guard next to Jeff Teague. As a result, he shot a lot of spot-up threes/jumpers, and ended the year by shooting 44% from the field and 33.5% from three-point land while adding just 3.4 assists per game.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the caveat of a role that he wasn\u2019t particular suited for, I thought Harris was just fine. He\u2019s still a solid, low-level starting point guard in this league and, at worst, he\u2019s a very good 3rd guard who can run the show with the second unit of any NBA team. He was a valuable, valuable asset.\n",

Detroit is really a beautiful place to go, you can see some really incredible architecture and art around the city. Not to mention there are some really amazing restaurants/bars where tons of younger people (20's-30's) go to hang out. Slows BBQ is amazing, Bucharest, Green Dot Stables, and The Sugar House. All of these are really nice, respectable places that you can get incredible food and meet some good people. I have been in and out of Detroit for most of my life and I love being down there. I say that you should really give it a chance and see for yourself. you may be surprised by some of the Gems Downtown. I really hope that you can open your mind and give it a chance. I see a ton of younger people moving into the city in order to clean it up and make it a great city. Check out https://www.facebook.com/detroitsoup when you get a chance. It is a place where people get together and raise money and come up with ideas to better the city one step at a time. Young 20 somethings like myself will bring the city back and hopfully to a better place than it has ever been before. I am really optimistic about the city and hope that you can learn to be to. I am only saying all of this because it is really tough to see all the trash on TV about Detroit and hear people that have never even been there that about how terrible it is. Thanks for reading all of this and I hope that I can help change your mind about the city.\n",

        "Canadians are obsessed with their culturally pervasive notion of superiority over Americans. They ignore the huge plurality of cultural similarities we share, deny that no two countries have ever been closer or more profitable allies for so long, and focus on the minor differences obsessively in a never-ending national rant about how awful our neighbours to the south are. It's infuriating. The Vancouver Olympics really brought out the worst in this tendency. Despite the shame it brings me as a Canadian, I am going to link to a facebook group created around the time of the Olympics: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Were-you-dissing-Canada-I-couldnt-hear-you-over-my-health-care-benefits/293179636779. I don't think you can read the content without joining, but the title of the group and the number of 'likes' should tell you about everything I hoped to convey by linking it.\n",
        "\n",
        "I never noticed this nonsense until I left the country - it turns out that Canadians have a really noticeable national 'small-man' complex, much worse than I've seen in the other 'little brother' nations like New Zealand, Scotland and Ireland, and it's pretty noticeable sometimes from those folks as well. When I went back for a visit, my little 12-year-old cousin at one point gave a very matter-of-fact dissertation on the ills of American culture which left me shaking my head.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, the things Canadians pick to brag about are barely even worthy of praise. I'm thinking here of health care, ironically because you mentioned that as a 'good' in your title. Wait times are atrocious. Because clinics and doctors' offices are essentially government entities, you don't find new ones opening as frequently as you would when there's financial incentive, and because a visit to the doctor is already paid for, people go for *every little thing*. My kid has a slight cough - BETTER GO TO THE CLINIC. Never mind that it's October and everyone in the fucking hemisphere has a slight cough.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, we pay for education. Canada is a country of almost 10,000,000 square kilometers, with the world's second-largest fossil fuel reserve, only 35,000,000 people paying ridiculously high taxes, and we ***still have to pay for University***. Why? OH, RIGHT. Rather than nationalising the energy industry like Norway (who's main national problem, if anyone else saw that front-pager yesterday, is that they have *too much money*), the Canadian forward-thinkers cowed to the demands of American commerce and allowed those precious resources to be extracted by private concerns.

ALSO not accounting for my before mention laptop he borrowed that i found out from a mutual friend HE BROKE A FEW MONTHS AGO AND NEVER PLANNED ON TELLING ME. before i knew that i asked him where the laptop was and he told me to my face that he had left it in the living room several months ago.\n",

Oliver, a guitarist, discovered he had a knack for writing songs and formed the blues-based King Johnson, which continues to do frequent gigs on the Southern circuit. Chris, a bassist, began playing jazz and rock in New York, eventually teaming up with John Medeski and Billy Martin to form the successful jazz-funk trio Medeski, Martin and Wood.

My interpretation of the situation is that his insurance company has paid about $1,000,000 for his treatment, and but his brain cancer is back.  The radiation treatment has failed, and another surgery comes with a 25% chance of death.  Nathan's family are starting this hot sauce company.  The goal is to raise $75,000 to pay for some treatment that isn't covered by insurance.

Gaining critical acclaim among music journalists, Calvi drew comparisons with the passionate and brooding musicianship of the likes of Nick Cave and PJ Harvey. The dense and rich musical influences that inhabit Calvi's world are broad and distinctive strokes of sultry flamenco, smoke-filled blues, and seductive goth pop/rock.

        "\n",
        "The culture of Austin is built on and around start-ups. (Tech startups to be specific) Kids that come out of high school know what a start-up is, and they think it's really cool. I didn't know what a start-up was until the summer of my senior year (of HS). And I'm among the youngest in our community. The culture of Houston doesn't really promote start-ups as much. Think Red Labs. Maybe 1/10 of the students are *aware* of Red Labs. 1/5 of that actually *know* what Red Labs is. It's really sad, because we have such a great location for start-ups. We have HTC, NASA, Engineers from Rice etc. (btw, Rice whoops our asses and hands it on a silver platter when it comes to Start-ups. And they don't even have a business major. ) The problem isn't the attempt to push for the culture change. I think the leaders of the movement are doing GREAT things. It's the community and the people in it.\n",

        "I have never done the entire thing start to finish because of knee issues and the lack of ability to do a true \"leg day\" workout, but I've done various workouts from all three phases. From my experience, the Phase 1 workouts are about 30 minutes long and meant to build muscle. They're just straight exercises and honestly super boring for me. Then phase 2 workouts are about 45 minutes of weights + 30 minutes of steady state cardio and meant as a maintenance phase. Higher reps with that but again just straight through and not a lot of super sets. Third phase workouts take at least 45 minutes, likely an hour, and are almost all supersets. Then on top of that you're supposed to do 30 minutes of HIIT (30 second sprint 30 second rest) after all non-leg days. \n",

        "The biggest issue I have with it is that if you do the program exactly as written out, you're talking about at least an hour and a half up to 2 hours in the gym every day from week 5 on unless you want to split it up and do cardio and weights separately. That's a long ass time to be in the gym! But, so many people seem to have success with it so obviously the dedication pays off. I'd love to one day do it all the way through but I don't think I'd actually stick with it unless I had someone there with me every day in the gym.\n",

        "I know that the concept is a difficult one to fathom, but I have lots of references of people that have participated in my \"trade-in\" program and they are overjoyed that finally someone out there is willing to give them the figures that they want only asking for their common figures in return.\n",

        "Well, I am able to this through \"leveraged buying and selling\".  I am a retired Senior-Financial-Analyst/Business-Systems-Solutions-Consultant/Senior-Software-Engineer.  I retired at the age of 36 and now live comfortably to where I can pursue hobbies such as this and apply the same concepts that I did in business to the goal of helping Lego Series Figures collectors obtain the figures that they want (We're talking about Series 1 Zombies here).  They go for upwards of $25 each (please go check on eBay or Brick Link and see...don't take my word for it.  As another Series gets added, the prices go up and up for all the harder to find figures.  Eventually, every collector of these figures will hit that \"glass ceiling\" in their collection where they can no longer trade for the figures that they are missing.\n",

        "As a former \"Business Systems Solutions Consultant\" I took a step back after completing my own personal collection a few months ago and was overwhelmed by the frustration of all of the friends that I had made along the way.

        "\n",
        "Well, I decided to put my so called \"money where my mouth is\" and financially back a program which is essentially the \"Game Stop\" model of trading in used games for the video games that people actually want to play.

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Bowling games come from all different developers who try to put their own \u201cspin\u201d on the sport.\n",
        "\n",
        "The best ones are based on simulation with realistic physics. Unfortunately, over the past decade and a half, so few games can meet the criteria of a good bowling game. Well, one company is here to change all of that.\n",
        "\n",
        "Over the last couple of years, the team over at Atlantic Corporation has been hard at work developing \u201cSpareball\u201d, a free-to-play bowling simulator that seamlessly blends real life simulation with fast paced gameplay. How well is it implemented? Read on to find out.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most bowling games try to simulate ball/pin physics and end up failing at that. This game doesn't try to hide anything behind flashy graphics or special effects. This game embraces the fact that its collision detection is right up there with the best bowling games. Although the pin physics are not 100% accurate, the game does a great job of leaving you with a satisfied feeling after a pocket hit. Now, please don\u2019t misinterpret that last statement, the gameplay is amazing even if the pins don\u2019t bounce out or slide around on the pin deck. Each pin also has its own sound, meaning if you hit 1 pin, you hear 1 pin. Hit 4 pins, your hear each of the 4 pins. It is a welcomed implementation after playing so many bowling games with \u201ccanned\u201d pin sound files.\n",
        "\n",
        "The graphics and frame rate on this game are very crisp and smooth. On par with what you can expect from any decent iOS game. It\u2019s the details that aren\u2019t first noticed that shows great care has been taken into creating this game. You roll the ball, you see your ball hit the pins and enter the ball return chute, and up out the ball return. Fine details, such as visiting the \u201cpro shop\u201d in-game provide you with seemingly endless options to provide each of the 9 bowling balls their own distinct characteristics; from changing the drilling layout, to sanding or polishing your bowling ball. These sliders fine tunes your ball to behave how you want it. This is a feature that has been largely missing from past bowling games.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another concept done very well in this game is the option to select an oil pattern. Since the advanced physics are taken into account, you will notice differences in the way each pattern is played. The ball slides in the oil, and reacts off of the friction very nicely.\n",
        "\n",
        "The game allows you to choose your own release for each ball, and a single swipe up throws the ball. This mechanic works to a degree, as fouling becomes prevalent in many games. As long as you don\u2019t get frustrated with too many fouls while learning the release mechanism, the game becomes very easy to get into a groove to string strikes together.\n",
        "\n",
        "The top selling point is the ability to view a replay from any shot thrown during the current game, as well as the ability to share the replay via Facebook for your friends to view. The replay function allows you to view from different camera angles, as well as view your release point, target, and break point each shot. Playback can either be normal speed or, for more dramatic effect, slow motion. The onscreen controls work just the same for the person viewing the replay on their Facebook page as the person watching the replay in-game. It is, by far, the coolest aspect of the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "Online multiplayer up to two people is fast with challenges for an online match result in a notification which, when tapped, immediately starts an online match. Local multiplayer is also supported for up to two players.\n",
        "The game could deter players with in-app purchases that range from $.99 to upwards of $15, but the quality of this game is well worth it. Plus, since this a free-to-play game, you are not obliged to pay anything.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another thing to note is that there is no music playing at any point. Feel free to load up your own music or favorite Internet radio app while playing. This is in no way a bad thing as I\u2019ve seen too many bowling games with terrible, unfitting music.\n",
        "\n",
        "The console is the \u201cmenu system\u201d, and is activated by touching the scoring monitor below the ball return. Sometimes, the interface can get a little clunky, but with no loading times, (other than the initial 10 second start-up loading screen), it is very easy to navigate between options and learn the ins and outs of the menu interface. Maybe a tutorial can be included in an update. Future updates may include online tournaments and an Android release.\n",
        "\n",
        "A very well done bowling game that sets the bar high for future bowling games, Spareball Bowling Simulator is a must have for people looking to play a great bowling game.\n",

        "Hm...that does make it considerably tougher. However, my previous point still stands. I'm not sure how close you are to Manila but most of the country's gay community tends to be centered around it's capital.\n",
        "\n",
        "Surround yourself with like minded people, and grow from there in a forward thinking community.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for resources, there are organizations such as ProGay-Philippines. It might be worth contacting them at their e-mail, *progay@gmail.com*.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also try to reach them at their [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Progressive-Organization-of-Gays-in-the-Philippines-Progay/185005544845512). They also have a [blog](http://progayphilippines.blogspot.com/) which they are reasonably active on.\n",

        "\n",
        "I wish I could be more help with regard to The Philippines LGBT scene. Obviously, I'm not all that familiar with it. Posting here at /r/lgbt was a great idea though. This community is always willing to offer advice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please consider what I've said about focusing on getting yourself independent, and sorting your education/career out. It is always easier to deal with these things when you have a stable home life, and support group to rely on.\n",

The view is amazing and bonus: it's a terrace bar, so you can order some very reasonably priced sparkling wine to celebrate just after! Now, there are two problems with Park. First, it's not going to be totally private. I'm sure the people within a 4 meter radius of you will see what's happening (especially if you go all romeo, down on the knee), so take that into consideration...although methinks the people will look, comment and go on with their lives. Second problem is that they don't reserve tables. If you look at the link above, I would want you to have the table on picture 2. If you decide to go for this plan, I offer to \"hold\" this table for you. I live within 200m of this place, so I'll go there beforehand, read a book and drink a few beers.

This all begins tomorrow. However, all the Instagram / Twitter followers (as well as facebook) here's something for you. Take a picture enjoying your Crown products, whichever it is, and post it up with the hashtag #Crown5Year and #Everyhookahneedsacrown (be sure to tag @Crownhookahs in them), THEN email me. Every person that throws a picture up with those tags will receive a little som-something from me. My favorite picture / video will receive a very special item I've been holding on to for a special occasion. Finally, next Sunday, on the final day of the 7 Days of Deals, I will be doing a stupid-awesome giveaway. I can't believe I'm going to give this away, it's a very special Crown piece that is one of a kind, and extremely valuable. More on this later. I you all.\n",

He studied composition and piano at Edinburgh University, the Royal Academy of Music and in Florence with Luciano Berio.      Though he has a strong background in the canons of classical music, his influences were more modern composers and in particular, Iannis Xenakis whose musical compositions applied mathematical and physical laws and Philip Glass whose sound was a major influence on Richter.

        "|**about artist**|Truckfighters is a stoner rock band from Sweden. After releasing several demos in 2001 and 2002, they recorded a split-EP with local Swedish band Firestone in 2003. In 2005 they released their debut album Gravity X on both MeteorCity Records and Fuzzorama Records. Their follow-up album, Phi, was released in 2007 by Poison Tree Records in the U.S. and on the Fuzzorama label elsewhere.

        "|**about artist**|This Will Destroy You was formed by guitarists Chris King and Jeremy Galindo, bassist Raymond Brown and drummer Andrew Miller in San Marcos, Texas, in 2005. They had met through mutual friends, and played together in various different bands throughout high school, before the line-up was finalised by around 2002. Early iterations of the band experimented with vocals, sung by Galindo, but after recording some tracks they decided the results were \u201cawful\u201d and didn\u2019t fit in with the rest of their music.

The duo have developed a truly unique sound whose experimental rhythms lend themselves to the fringes of dubstep, wonky and hip hop, but ooze with emotion and echoing ambient soundscapes that take the listener to an entirely different place.   Their EPs, released on Hotflush Recordings, have already been well received, with support from pioneering DJs including Mary Anne Hobbs, Scuba, Rob Booth and Ramadanman ([more on last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/Mount Kimbie))|  \n",

My self and a large amount of people from the Australian population would like too see this sport become a reality here, Airsoft is a sport much similar to paintball but more aimed towards People who enjoy Military Simulation &amp; Video games, this sport if it were to come to Australia would open up many doors for small &amp; Large business to invest in the sport as well as numerous other benefits such as getting kids heads out of the video games and into the broader community at large, this will also help the obesity crisis which we are currently facing, this will teach people young and old honor and respect, as well as great physical exercise and social skills, The Airsoft Taggers themselves impact less then a paintball marker and the 6mm plastic bio-degradable BB's that they fire are completely harmless to the environment &amp; with correct eye protection harmless to other players/Humans they would also be regulated heavily as is the current firearms of today, but with special acts &amp; laws to accommodate this type of Import i am positive that with the correct measures in place this sport can be brought to this great nation for all to enjoy and participate in\n",

        "Basically the \"asstronaut (proper spelling is ASStronaut)\" suspension was first done and named by a group called Rites of Passage about 10 years ago as a bit of a joke. The two ladies that appear in this photo did this suspension on a dare from numerous people. We (Ritual Flesh Suspension Team) intended the suspension to be a laugh for our supporters in our home town and within the suspension community. We never intended it to get such a huge reaction (we just did the suspension on 09/01/13)! But what can you expect when you hang a couple ladies by their bum cheeks :)\n",
        "\n",
        "Now on to a bit more about suspension in general... flesh hook suspension has been performed for centuries in various cultures, the most notable being the Native American Sun Dance and O-Kee-Pa. People do suspensions for all sorts of reason; spiritual enlightenment, personal transcendence, empowerment, an adrenaline rush, etc. I suppose really you could liken it to any thrill seeking activity; sky diving, marathon running, base jumping, rock climbing. This just happens to be my hobby like anyone else. The cool thing about my hobby is that I get to travel all over the country and perform it for people. I do not get any type of emotional or spiritual gain from it, suspending comes very easily to me and I have a great time doing it! A lot of people wonder about physical harm from suspending- I personally have been performing flesh hook suspension for about 3 years and have done countless suspensions. I have never once hurt myself or required any type of medical attention following a suspension. Apart for s few small (about magic marker point sized) scars, I have no physical damage from suspending. The worst I have ever experienced is some minor muscle soreness the following day much like I had worked out really hard. I do feel that it is prudent to point out that suspension is VERY dangerous and should only be performed by professionals, there are hundreds of us around the country and we have forums as well as conventions where we all meet to discuss safety and standards. I will try to answer any questions in response to my post, and anyone is free to contact my team directly via facebook https://www.facebook.com/RitualFlesh or our website http://ritualflesh.com/   Please keep in mind that we are a dedicated team and this is our passion, we do not tolerate any form of harassment and/or bullying and we show the same respect to all no matter if we agree with them or not. \n",

The band's best known lineup consisted of Vaden Todd Lewis (guitar, vocals) Mark Reznicek (drums), Lisa Umbarger (bass), and Clark Vogeler (guitar).

This song was named after Possum Kingdom State Park, in Palo Pinto County, Texas. ([more on last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/Toadies))|  \n",

This man mixes lots of things into his hard-rocking spirit. I don't always play to score even though I transcript all the songs I play. However, That's Chad Szeliga right there, I need to play like him~ So I try really hard to stick to the original drum part.

I myself went to state schools all the way through and received proper and thorough lessons on Japanese history and know exactly what happened before the WWII. It is very unfair to generalise about history lessons in Japan based on her or her friends' experience only, as that's far away from the reality. As for Mr. Fijioka, he is one of those hardcore right wingers and not many Japanese people share such extreme opinion. History is certainly written by winners but I would say Japanese education overall has been rather modest in this regard being as honest about the nation's past as it can be.\n",

        "&gt;**Yuri Yanazaki** It depends on history teacher or school which u go. Not every school obeys text book!! Teacher who wants to tell the truth to his/her students, they can tell! Nothing to hide. It's not like Japanese education system bans the truth. I learned everything what Japanese did to China or Korea in the school! even though our text book didn't mention the details of the event, my teacher told us everything and showed us the pictures a lot! I really think it depends on teacher and school!!!\n",
        "\n",
        "I'm one of those whose personal experience severely differed from the one Oi described as well. I don't have a proper poll on what Japanese kids learn on these kinds of issues, of course, so I can't say exactly how many schools teach this kind of stuff, but like I said ~20% of the schools are Teacher's Union schools so those schools are likely to be the ones that teach about the war crimes in detail.\n",

        "Father and mother were newly engaged and conceived Veronica in 2008.  With the news, father wanted to speed the wedding along, mother didn't.  Mother broke off engagement and she/they broke off contact.  Before baby was born, mother made adoption arrangements to couple in SC behind father's back.  When she gave birth, prospective adoptive parents were part of the birthing.  Father wasn't told about birth and mother didn't list herself in hospital so people couldn't find her there.  When V was 8 days old, she went with PAPs to SC. Father still didn't know.  When V was 4 mths old, and just before father was deploying to Iraq, he was served with papers he thought were to give custody of V to her mother since he was deploying.  After he signed, he was told that he had just agreed to allow V to be adopted.  From that day, he has been fighting in courts to gain/keep custody of V and stop the adoption (3.5 yrs ago).\n",
        "\n",
        "V lived with SC couple/PAP's for 27 mths.  Ever since V was 4 mths old, PAPs clearly knew father contested adoption and wanted to raise her.  When V was 2 yrs old, the SCarolina courts granted custody to father.  V's been living with her father and his wife for almost 2 yrs now.  Her paternal grandparents and her older half-sister are all close by.  Everyone takes an active role in her life.  She'll be 4 yrs old in 2 wks.\n",
        "\n",
        "After the SC Supreme Court gave custody to father, PAPs appealed and brought case to SCOTUS who recently gave it back to SCSC.  On July 31, 2013, father gave temporary guardianship to V's paternal grandparents his wife, because he had to go to mandatory National Guard training.  A few hours later, SCSC hastily finalized adoption, despite that V was no longer with them in SC, but happily living with father for the last 20 mths.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Father is actively contesting adoption because several laws were compromised to get V to SC and stop father from fighting adoption.  PAPs side is demanding that adoption is done in SC and V should return to SC ASAP.  PAPs and SC have issued father's arrest while he was out-of-state on mandatory national guard training for not handing her over already.  Because V is resident of OK, OK needs to approve SC adoption before she can be handed over. OK still hasn't approved and father supporters hope OK won't.\n",

        "It's a complicated battle over jurisdiction (SC vs OK; US federal vs Cherokee sovereignty).  Both father and daughter are Cherokee and US citizens.\n",

FTL, Dustforce, (Which, by the way, is confirmed to release on Vita and PS4 soon) and Super Meat Boy and but a few titles among the near-hundreds requested by fans. And, to the delight of the fans, Sony really seems to be listening. In fact, Sony (and 2K games) announced at Gamescom that Borderlands 2 would be releasing on the Playstation Vita, due to popular demand. This not only proves that Sony is listening, but that they care a lot about what they are listening to. And the icing on the cake is Sony\u2019s new third party department, designed specifically to bring new games over to Playstation systems.\n",

Twitter is the easiest outlet for them, so a simple \u201cHey, can you try to get Amnesia on PS4 and Vita please #AmnesiaPS4 #AmnesiaVita?\u201d will do just fine. Another surefire way of getting our campaign noticed is by directly contacting Fricitonal games. They may not be as readily available, but it\u2019d be kind of weird if we didn\u2019t try to contact them. I mean, they did make the game, after all. Finally (unless you can find other ways!), one of the most crucial parts of this campaign is spreading it around.

        "    Whether you believe it or not, what you are about to hear really did happen on our Alpaca farm here in Pennsylvania earlier this week.  The Matriarch of the farm is named Toumai. She is my tattle- tell girl that comes nose to nose with me and stares at me wide-eyed when there is a problem in her pasture. Otherwise she doesn\u2019t come to me at all. She normally doesn\u2019t give me the time of day.  She is extremely reliable and we have a good working relationship. When she says there is a problem, there is a problem. Well, she stared me down first thing in the morning. So I figured one of my pregnant girls was in the early stages of labor, I just didn\u2019t know who yet. As I was excitedly getting ready for our second baby of the season, I realized that it was Toumai that was in labor.  This was not her first baby (all boys so far) so she knows what to do. Although, I was wondering why she was asking for my help since she didn\u2019t look at all uncomfortable yet.   \n",
        "\n",
        "    After a few hours it became obvious that she was in trouble. She came to me several times to tell me that she needed me . So, I finally listened to her. I called for some backup  (a very nice neighbor and my son who just stepped off the bus) and I washed my hands. I did an internal examine and discovered that not only was the baby breech but there was a heck of a lot of bleeding.  I needed the Vet. The chance of survival of a breech alpaca is slim. After consulting the vet by phone (she was 2 hours away and would not make it in time), my two helpers  held and talked to Toumai and I went in to rearrange this baby.  Not only was the baby breech but both back legs were folded. I needed to push the baby in as far as possible, push each leg back even further and grab each foot, one at a time, to bring the baby out feet first. That was the plan. Since I already broke the water, it was like a vacuum packed contracting muscle trying to push out while I was trying to push in\u2026while laying on the barn floor in a pool of\u2026..everything. Oddly enough, the blood served as a lubricant.  Toumai was very patient with me considering I had both my arms in there up to my shoulders!  It is amazing how much courage and physical strength you get when there is no other choice.  After a considerable amount of blood, sweat, and grunting and groaning from everybody\u2026I found both back feet and pulled out the back legs which was quickly followed by a slippery baby\u2026.a girl\u2026and it was alive! We then switched our efforts to getting this baby to breathe properly.  She was very weak as well.  We swung here around upside down and pounded on her chest to clear the congestion. We couldn\u2019t believe that we did this! And the baby is alive!! We were exhausted yet excited. \n",
        "\n",
        "    As soon as we were satisfied that the baby was Ok,  we started congratulating each other . I then turned to Toumai and she was in my face humming\u2026.loud!  The ordeal was not over yet\u2026she was prolapsing her uterus with the placenta still attached!!!  Here we go again! Her uterus was actually turning inside out and was coming out\u2026..the whole way out.  This was most definitely not normal, not expected, and the most foreign thing I have every seen. After another call to the Vet, I got further instructions. With my 2 helpers holding Toumai, I gathered all of the loose and slippery parts and pushed with all of my strength (while she was pushing out) to get this uterus back in. It was huge! The placenta luckily just separated and fell off.  The uterus finally went in and I arranged it in its proper position.  As soon as I removed my hands, her humming stopped, her pushing stopped, the bleeding stopped and she ran over to check the baby. She checked that baby from head to toe and then something absolutely unbelievable happened. She went to each of us, one by one, and kissed us all over our faces. I think, no\u2026 I know, she was thanking us. Now, there were tears.  Neither one of them was supposed to live. The only reason they did was because Toumai can talk.  \n",
        "\n",
        "    The Vet never did get there in person. And now, two days later, both Momma and baby Delilah are romping in the pasture with everyone else.  Toumai lets me interact with the baby anytime I want. She even leaves me to \u201cbabysit\u201d while she goes to the other end of the pasture for the really good grass. Toumai will not have anymore babies but she still has the full-time job of Matriarch of her herd and Alpaca Translator.      \n",

VNV Nation began as a one man project from Ronan Harris.  In 1995 Mark Jackson joined the band permanently as a live drummer.  VNV Nation's inspiration was originally the clash of the modern and classical European cultures, where mythology and technology live in an uneasy fusion, but this has since broadened to encompass a world view.

Arif, Imran and Raza bring you the results from game week three in the Barclay\u2019s Premier League as well as taking a look at the fixtures for game week four, and providing our predictions. Imran asks Raza to give his verdict on the goal, player and the manager of game week three and although we are three weeks into the league, all three of us provide our very own Premier League preview; where we look at who will be crowned the Premier League champions; who will complete the top four, the Golden Boot winner etc. We also take a look at the latest transfer gossip with some big news surrounding Gareth Bale, Mesut \u00d6zil and the continued transfer frustrations surrounding Manchester United. Arif enlightens us all with his very first theory of the week; and as promised, a world exclusive as Imran and Raza sat down with a very \u2018Special\u2019 guest earlier in the week and conducted a very interesting interview. We also take a look at a couple of articles from GiveMeSport; before concluding with a quick quiz between Arif and Raza; testing their football knowledge.\n",

        "[Steady Hands](http://steadyhands.bandcamp.com/album/the-earth-will-eat-today) Melodic Hardcore. Songs in the vein of bands like Defeater. Absolutely incredible energy.

        "\n",
        "[Kids These Days](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsO8jZBfYtM) - Indie/Hip Hop/Rock/Jazz/etc. You might have seen these guys on Conan once, or playing at SxSW. I went to high school with like, half the lineup. They're cool guys, though they broke up unfortunately. Never an impossibility for a reunion, though.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Perfect Kiss](https://soundcloud.com/perfect-kiss) - New Wave Revival. Cool guys that my ex digs a lot. Cool band. I think I saw their name on North Coast Music and Wave Front Fest's bills to boot, so they might be up and coming still.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Chance The Rapper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8nIHZ-0kS4) - Rap. Chicagos hometown rap star hero. Pretty cool album, and I liked it enough. Even if it isn't my thing in general, I totally see the appeal. Living proof that you can be big without being famous (or is it vice versa?)\n",

        "My company sells to hundreds of non-profit tax exempt organizations each month. Currently we do NOT have to collect tax exempt forms from our customers that reside outside of Minnesota. We only have nexus in Minnesota; therefore, we are not required to charge sales tax on the transactions outside of Minnesota. Avalara is one of the certified software providers that are supposed to provide FREE software to calculate the sales tax (if the Marketplace Fairness Act passes). The software to calculate the sales tax might be free (subsidized by the taxpayer) but exemption certificate management is not included in the wording of the pending legislation. It is NOT free and it would be very expensive. My company has two employees (my wife and I). It would be impossible for us to manage exemption certificates without being forced to buy into expensive software. If the MFA passes all of our online orders to sales tax exempt organizations will result in telephone calls or email where they will ask us to remove the sales tax. It will be a major time issue when we are a 2 person company to collect certificates and change sales receipts. Then we will have to log into our website and list the customer as tax exempt for future orders. What takes us 30 seconds now to process an order will take us an additional 10 minutes per exempt order to respond to the customer, get the certificate, file it, go online and change them to an exempt customer.  There is nothing FREE or STREAMLINED about the exemption certificate process. Avalara even writes there are, \u201cNO universal rules on tax-ability or exemptions.\u201d In my opinion, the states have a long way to go on their streamlined rules that would be required under the pending legislation. This legislation would hinder Interstate commerce if it is passed.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition it will cost us about $20,000 to integrate the FREE tax software mentioned in the legislation into our websites.  The software is supposedly free but it only plugs into some of the shopping carts on the market.  The business owner must then pay to have it installed and map all of their items to a state run database to determine taxability.\n",
        "\n",
        "We sell alot of procuts to the elderly population.  Many of our sales are telephone orders.  Currently we only have to calculate one sales tax for the items we sell.  If the legislation passes we will have to calculate the taxability of each item based on zip code.  Some products are taxable, some are not, it depends on where the item will ship.  Some states tax shipping some do not.  If a customer calls and orders lets say 15 different items my wife will have to determine the taxability of each item.  What normally would take 3 minutes on a phone order will take her 15 minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also many seniors do order via traditional mail order.  We do still get checks in the mail.  I think Amerimark said they receive well over 1 million mail orders a year.  This legislation will require the person that is ordering by mail to write the check for the correct tax.  Again, some items have a tax and some do not depending on the state, county, city, indian tribe, etc...It would be nearly impossible to put an insert into a traditional mail order catalog that would cover over 9,600 different taxing jurisdictions.  \n",

        "The traffic is always that bad. The worst being typically in the coastal range for van one and van 2. I was and am always in van 1 so if your issues were traffic with van 2 then I can not say much about it. But in van ones routes it gets logged up with teams trying to cheat the routes by not entering the parking areas and trying to park on the road. Alot of the elite teams think they need to do this to keep up with the faster pace of their runners. But really all it does is cause mayhem for everyone else. I at one point had to jump out of my van with my teams time clipboard and run the last 2 miles of a teammates leg with him to the next check point so we could make the exchange to van 2 without losing any time. Just use common sense and don't waste any time stopping on the side of the road for your runners and usually things work out well. 2 years ago it was a bit worse than this year so I would have to say its pretty normal.

Formed in 2006, the group was founded by brothers Vic and Mike Fuentes after the disbandment of the group Before Today (formerly Early Times), which was formed out of the San Diego punk rock scene. Pierce the Veil has released two studio albums and has continuously been inducted into several worldwide tours since the release of their debut album, A Flair For The Dramatic in 2007. A new album, titled Collide With The Sky, was recently announced for release on July 17th, 2012, under the label Fearless Records. ([more on last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/Pierce the Veil))|  \n",

        "4. Sign up for lots and lots of newsletters. They'll tell you when they're putting up new coupons, or they'll send you a link via email. You might want to consider a free Gmail account just for couponing, so you don't clog up your regular inbox.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. If you don't sign up for newsletters, just check the websites. My kids don't drink a lot of soda but they do drink milk, juice, and water by the boatload. I always go with the Old Orchard juices, particularly their Healthy Balance blend. [Old Orchard](http://oldorchard.com) always has coupons on their site and you can even collect points for better coupons. I don't know if you have a Harris Teeter by you, but they frequently run \"buy 2, get 3\" sales on this juice. Since you can almost always print two copies of Internet Printable coupons (IPs), and HT doubles up to 20 coupons daily up to $.99, I can get the Healthy Balance juice for cheap, cheap.\n",

        "6. Facebook is your friend! There was a $1/1 coupon for fresh pork the other day at this page: http://www.facebook.com/PorkBeInspired?ref=br_tf. It's over now but they've posted them pretty frequently. A Full Cup at one point had a list of companies that regularly offer printable coupons from Facebook but I can't seem to find it. Anyway, you'll find lots of coupons there - the first day of every month, [Nabisco](http://www.facebook.com/nabisco) puts up its monthly \"Cookies and Milk\" coupon. 50,000 copies, varies a lot. Sometimes it's buy two whatever cookie they're pushing, get $1 off but occasionally, you'll find $1 off milk when you buy two Oreos, etc.\n",

        "|**about artist**|Billy Joe Shaver is an American country music singer/songwriter. He was born August 16, 1939 in Corsicana, Texas. Shaver's 1973 album Old Five and Dimers Like Me is a classic in the outlaw country genre.  Shaver was raised by his mother, Victory Watson Shaver, after his father Virgil left the family before he was born. Until he was 12, he spent a great deal of time with his grandmother in Waco, Texas so that his mother could work. He sometimes accompanied his mother to her job at a local nightclub, where he began to be exposed to country music.[1] ([more on last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/Billy Joe Shaver))|  \n",

Joe was nice enough to let me purchase a few 3D printed parts like the cable hole plug that made this look much better. As you can see in the pictures i started with an old controller i pulled out of my attic that was no longer working. i started gutting out areas to make room for the components. after that i moved to cutting the original PCB that was inside the controller to make room for the DNA chip and screen. Most of the cutting on the controller was done without a dremel, i used a pair of nice snips. from the beginning i wanted to make this mod but with something different to set it apart, so i put in a volt meter board to test actual voltage at the battery. This also allowed me to view voltage under load at the battery. Inserting the VM in to the controller was no easy task but i managed. next i had to drill and mount the switches for the up down fire and the A button that gives you the voltage. after that putting everything together to test fit including the 510 connector. once i knew everything would fit i used epoxy on the 510 and the USB charge board and let it all dry. i am sure i left out a few steps.. so please feel free to ask away. i will also post a list of materials for anyone who is interested. \n",

If our methods are able to reliably identify comments containing personal information, we could write a program which continuously polls the stream of new comments on Reddit and alerts us, and potentially the user, to new personal posts.
