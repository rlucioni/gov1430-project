Those wavelengths are well within the 390-700nm a healthy human eye is capable of seeing. The thing is your eyes don't just see blue at 450nm; blue for humans is technically defined as 450\u2013495 nm so although the colour composite is using part of blue, it's not using all of blue.

        "When it comes to 'visible light' (image processors never use the term \"true colour\" because it's a loaded term and pretty much useless) what is happening is we're taking three long exposure images (or multiple exposures stacked) shot at specific wavelengths like 450nm, 532nm, and 635nm which represents blue, green, and red in that order and we're putting them together into an RGB composite. Those wavelengths are well within the 390-700nm a healthy human eye is capable of seeing. The thing is your eyes don't just see blue at 450nm; blue for humans is technically defined as 450\u2013495 nm so although the colour composite is using part of blue, it's not using all of blue. That makes the image an accurate representation of part of the visible spectrum (using long exposures) but not an accurate representation of the whole human visible spectrum.\n",

        "Father and mother were newly engaged and conceived Veronica in 2008.  With the news, father wanted to speed the wedding along, mother didn't.  Mother broke off engagement and she/they broke off contact.  Before baby was born, mother made adoption arrangements to couple in SC behind father's back.  When she gave birth, prospective adoptive parents were part of the birthing.  Father wasn't told about birth and mother didn't list herself in hospital so people couldn't find her there.  When V was 8 days old, she went with PAPs to SC. Father still didn't know.  When V was 4 mths old, and just before father was deploying to Iraq, he was served with papers he thought were to give custody of V to her mother since he was deploying.  After he signed, he was told that he had just agreed to allow V to be adopted.  From that day, he has been fighting in courts to gain/keep custody of V and stop the adoption (3.5 yrs ago).\n",
        "\n",
        "V lived with SC couple/PAP's for 27 mths.  Ever since V was 4 mths old, PAPs clearly knew father contested adoption and wanted to raise her.  When V was 2 yrs old, the SCarolina courts granted custody to father.  V's been living with her father and his wife for almost 2 yrs now.  Her paternal grandparents and her older half-sister are all close by.  Everyone takes an active role in her life.  She'll be 4 yrs old in 2 wks.\n",
        "\n",
        "After the SC Supreme Court gave custody to father, PAPs appealed and brought case to SCOTUS who recently gave it back to SCSC.  On July 31, 2013, father gave temporary guardianship to V's paternal grandparents his wife, because he had to go to mandatory National Guard training.  A few hours later, SCSC hastily finalized adoption, despite that V was no longer with them in SC, but happily living with father for the last 20 mths.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Father is actively contesting adoption because several laws were compromised to get V to SC and stop father from fighting adoption.  PAPs side is demanding that adoption is done in SC and V should return to SC ASAP.  PAPs and SC have issued father's arrest while he was out-of-state on mandatory national guard training for not handing her over already.  Because V is resident of OK, OK needs to approve SC adoption before she can be handed over. OK still hasn't approved and father supporters hope OK won't.\n",

        "It's a complicated battle over jurisdiction (SC vs OK; US federal vs Cherokee sovereignty).  Both father and daughter are Cherokee and US citizens.\n",

        "Hope that helps.  This is the most expensive adoption debate in US history I heard.\n",
        "\n",
        "My bias: V's best interest is with her father.  Looking at pictures of the two of them - both are GLOWING.  And she'll grow up with her roots around her.  Father clearly takes care of her.  Mother doesn't want to raise her, so she should be able to grow up with her father.\n",
