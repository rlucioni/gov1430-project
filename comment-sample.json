The twist with Carson City is that it is a wild west theme so meeples can be placed anywhere. Want to take over the profits of someone else's saloon? Place your meeple there. If they don't respond, you share the profits. If they do respond by placing their own meepl there, you have a gun duel for supremacy of the space. This shared-space/gun fight mechanic applies to everyspace on the board (I think). It's a great blend of mechanics.",
